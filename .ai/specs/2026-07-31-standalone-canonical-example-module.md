# Standalone Canonical Example Module

- **Status:** Draft
- **Date:** 2026-08-01
- **Revised:** 2026-08-03
- **Scope:** OSS, standalone applications emitted by `create-mercato-app`
- **Related:** [Standalone AI Development Harness](./2026-07-24-standalone-ai-development-harness.md), [Standalone Agent Spec-First Routing](./2026-08-01-standalone-agent-spec-first-routing.md), [Standalone Harness Example and Linked-Source Read Policy](./2026-08-01-standalone-harness-example-read-policy.md), [Standalone Harness Knowledge Governance](./2026-08-01-standalone-harness-knowledge-governance.md), [Empty App Starter Presets](./2026-04-02-empty-app-starter-presets.md), merged PR [#4529](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4529), design-foundation PR [#4277](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4277), design-system gallery PR [#4301](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4301), module-facts PR [#4883](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4883), follow-up issue [#4670](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/issues/4670)

## TLDR

The standalone template already contains a comprehensive `example` module, but the `empty` and `crm` preset resolver deletes it while the default `classic` scaffold enables it. Do not create a second teaching module that copies the same entities, routes, commands, forms, UMES branches, and tests. Make the existing `example` tree the one canonical module reference: ship it in every built-in scaffold, keep it absent from every generated `src/modules.ts`, add progressive-disclosure source maps, and extend the existing Todo-centered vertical slice only for capability gaps that the current tree does not cover.

`apps/mercato/src/modules/example/**` is the authoring source. `packages/create-app/template/src/modules/example/**` is a byte-identical mirror maintained by the existing `yarn template:sync:fix` workflow and enforced by `yarn template:sync`. Standalone guides, skills, references, generated module facts, and harness cases contain visible Markdown links to exact files under the emitted `src/modules/example/**` root or, for specialist implementation depth beyond the representative example, exact source shipped by the installed package under `node_modules/@open-mercato/**`. UI rows additionally point to the PR #4301 living design-system gallery entry and live gallery route that demonstrate the actual shipped component used by `example`; the example imports the public `@open-mercato/ui` component, never gallery internals. A machine-readable parity ledger supplements those visible links; evaluator permissions alone do not satisfy the contract. No shadow teaching module, template-only example fork, copied reference implementation, or reference experience that exposes only package facts while omitting the separate local-example reference bundle is allowed.

## Overview

This specification changes generated-source delivery and agent guidance, not the framework module contract. Fresh scaffolds gain a local reference tree but no example runtime behavior: no routes, pages, navigation, migrations, seeds, ACL grants, events, widgets, workers, or search registrations load until a developer explicitly enables or copies the module.

The existing example is intentionally broad because it also supports monorepo QA. Progressive disclosure makes that breadth useful to standalone agents without asking them to read or copy the whole tree. Normative rules stay in the owning skills and guides; the example README and machine-readable surface inventory point to the smallest executable slice for each capability.

## Resolved Decisions

| # | Question | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Reuse `example` or add a second teaching module? | Reuse and extend `example`; a shadow module is forbidden. | The current tree already implements the majority of the proposed vertical slice. Copying it would create two owners and guaranteed drift. |
| Q2 | Should the example run in new apps? | No. Ship its source in every built-in preset but omit `example` from every generated `src/modules.ts`. | Agents and developers can inspect it without changing runtime, navigation, schema, or seed behavior. |
| Q3 | Which copy is authoritative? | `apps/mercato/src/modules/example/**` is the authoring source; the create-app template is an exact materialized mirror. | The monorepo app is the real integration environment, and the existing template-sync workflow already mirrors `apps/mercato/src/{app,components,lib,modules}` into create-app. |
| Q4 | How are missing surfaces added? | Extend the existing Todo-centered example in focused files, tests, and migrations. | A missing capability does not justify another module, placeholder discovery file, or pasted skill snippet. |
| Q5 | How does the harness consume the reference? | Relevant cases receive bounded `exampleRoots` entries rooted at `src/modules/example`; the first entrypoint is its README or surface map. | Exact capability links let an agent read only what the prompt needs and avoid the test-only `ratelimit_probe`. |
| Q6 | Add a new harness case or extend an existing one? | Semantically deduplicate first, especially against OMH-185 and existing discovery/UMES cases. | Coverage behavior matters; case-number allocation is not a design goal. |
| Q7 | Split delivery, gap closure, and reference-specific harness proof? | Keep one umbrella contract but make delivery, each gap slice, harness migration, and certification independently mergeable milestones; generic read semantics, governance, and spec-first policy remain separate companion specs. | The user explicitly requires one shipped, complete, discoverable example contract, while independent milestones prevent source delivery, a single gap, or link migration from becoming one atomic high-risk implementation. |
| Q8 | Is evaluator permission sufficient to restore the old harness examples? | No. Every implementation-bearing knowledge owner must contain visible exact-file links, and the harness must preserve the implementation-topic coverage formerly supplied by embedded snippets on `main`. | A read allowance cannot teach an agent which source to open, and prose-only replacements silently lost executable reference coverage. |
| Q9 | How should DataTable bulk actions and progress be demonstrated? | Extend the existing Todo list into one connected selected-row bulk-operation slice that returns a real `progressJobId`, queues command-mediated work, and drives the platform top progress bar. | The current example has a customers bulk-action injection and a separate synthetic progress page, but it does not show the production DataTable bulk-action-to-progress contract end to end. |
| Q10 | How exhaustive is PR #4883 extension/module-fact coverage? | Cover every executable source convention, discriminant kind, activation mechanism, target kind, activation policy, and currently bound DataTable/CrudForm surface once in `example`; classify framework-owned, reserved, or currently unbound catalog values explicitly and link their exact authority instead of fabricating runtime code. | “Every kind” means exhaustive mechanisms, not a Cartesian product across every business module. A generated enum-driven ledger keeps that boundary finite and detects drift. |
| Q11 | How does the harness teach visual component choice? | For every canonical example UI capability, pair the exact example source with a direct PR #4301 gallery entry when present, or with checked constituent entries for an unrepresented composite such as `CrudForm`/`DataTable`, plus the exact UI implementation. Ship the gallery source but mark its route `source-only` in every new standalone preset until explicit opt-in. | The gallery is the visual discovery surface and `example` is the integrated module-use surface; linking both honestly avoids stale screenshots, false composite claims, copied snippets, and direct coupling between the modules while keeping fresh apps runtime-inert. |
| Q12 | Which harness items reference PR #4277? | Every design-system item derived from the PR #4301 gallery, including entries not consumed by `example` and each direct or composite constituent entry that is consumed, carries PR #4277 token/Code Connect/design-skill provenance and an explicit availability/status record. Unrelated non-UI harness items do not receive a decorative link. | “All items” is exhaustive across the standalone design-system inventory, while explicit unmapped/placeholder/unavailable states avoid fabricating Figma or Code Connect coverage. |

## Problem Statement

`packages/create-app/src/lib/starter-presets.ts` currently removes `src/modules/example` and `src/modules/example_customers_sync` for `empty`; `crm` inherits that removal. `classic` bypasses preset rewriting, so the template's current `src/modules.ts` enables `example`. This creates two bad outcomes:

1. lean standalone apps retain the narrow `ratelimit_probe` fixture but lose the only comprehensive local module example; and
2. the proposed remedy duplicates much of the already-shipped example under a new module ID, adding a second implementation and a second maintenance surface.

At the 2026-08-03 design baseline, the template example contains 136 files and 746,030 file bytes. The scaffold copier intentionally omits `__tests__` and `__integration__`, leaving 104 runtime/reference files and 555,327 file bytes in a generated app. The repository tree already covers CRUD, commands and undo, custom fields, OpenAPI, list export, an `updatedAt`-bearing editable entity, backend forms and tables, typed events, subscribers, notification types/handlers, response enrichers, mutation guards, API and command interceptors, component replacement, dashboard widgets, customers/catalog/sales injections, unified overrides, migrations, ACL, setup, DI, CLI, i18n, and extensive integration coverage.

The two repository copies are not currently identical: 20 paths differ, including command scope/redo behavior, a missing command test, page metadata, integration fixtures, and locale/test formatting. The existing `yarn template:sync` command already detects this drift because `modules/**` is in its sync set. This spec turns a passing exact-sync check into a release requirement and requires the baseline reconciliation to preserve the safer/correct behavior rather than copying the stale side blindly.

The whole-harness audit used `main` commit `f7c941570003f3abe920b1765995cbef98dcad0b` as the finite compatibility baseline. Its emitted root-instruction template and seven implementation skills contain 136 CommonMark fenced blocks across module anatomy, backend UI, data modeling, ejection, integrations, module scaffolding, UMES, and troubleshooting. The current core implementation-owner set—one root template, nine guides, 24 skill entrypoints, and 58 skill references—contains no Markdown link to `src/modules/example`. Some routing, workflow, upgrade, tracker, harness-operation, and report examples remain self-authoritative, but the eight implementation families are prose-only. The implementation must classify every deterministic baseline fence and close its implementation-topic coverage gap rather than assuming better evaluator access restores it.

The PR #4883 audit adds a second finite compatibility baseline: commit `092e56572c8dc5a22c5a53e913862fd8324cc842`, especially `packages/cli/src/lib/generators/module-extension-facts.ts`, `module-facts.ts`, `module-override-targets.ts`, and `packages/shared/src/modules/widgets/extension-points.ts`. That SHA is the review input, not permission to freeze defects found during #4883 review: implementation/certification records the final approved or merged SHA and regenerates the literal ledger when it differs. The current example has runtime examples that the static readers cannot see because `widgets/injection-table.ts` and `widgets/components.ts` export conditional/spread-shaped registries; it also lacks local declarations for several newly source-linked fact families. Package build currently extracts every package-provided module into the combined JSON and all package Markdown sheets, after which scaffold setup filters only Markdown to enabled package modules; neither stage extracts app-local modules. A standalone agent would therefore not receive a local `example` reference projection even after those source gaps were closed. This specification requires the example code, static readers, reference-fact stage, generated facts, visible links, and activated runtime tests to agree without changing those normal-output semantics.

The PR #4301 audit adds the visual design-system baseline: provenance head `186af58044c7530885a889c41f53bb36a5093d82`, merged on 2026-08-03 as develop/package baseline `bf25803d7a8c85c8552db9e76c7cc4398d1768be`. `packages/core/src/modules/design_system/gallery/registry.ts` owns the family manifest and route/Figma/docs constants, `gallery/types.ts` owns the entry shape, `gallery/entries/*.tsx` owns live variants and copyable public imports, and `gallery/__tests__/gallery-coverage.test.ts` guards primitive coverage. `baselineSha` means the merged/package commit; `provenanceHeadSha` records the PR head. PR #4301 enabled `design_system` in the create-app template; this spec intentionally reverses only that fresh-standalone default so installed source remains available but generated apps are runtime-inert. Certification verifies that exact core/UI sources from the merged baseline exist in the packed standalone app even though the module registration is absent. The harness preserves [PR #4301](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4301) as design provenance while resolving implementation reads to exact versioned installed files. It must not use the PR page, screenshots, Figma, or a live route as a substitute for source, and `example` must not import `design_system` module internals.

The PR #4277 design-foundation audit is pinned only as provisional provenance at open, changes-requested, conflicting head `fb9b8ddfe4470ef11d312caa4628c46af7d48adf`; it has no merged/package baseline yet. Its authoritative proposed surfaces are `src/app/globals.css` as emitted token truth, `.ai/ds/ds-tokens.json` as the deterministic snapshot, `scripts/ds-tokens-export.mjs` as exporter/drift logic, `packages/ui/figma/*.figma.tsx` as finite Code Connect mappings, and opt-in `.ai/skills/om-figma-design-with-ds/**` guidance. The current head includes incomplete/placeholder Figma node coverage, incomplete component variant mapping, and a design skill with unresolved taxonomy/reference defects, so [PR #4277](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4277) may be rendered as provenance now but its proposed artifacts cannot become certified readable authorities until the PR merges and emitted/packed availability is verified.

## Proposed Solution

1. Stop removing `src/modules/example` from lean presets and remove `example` from the default classic registry so all built-in scaffolds have the same source-present/runtime-disabled contract.
2. Keep `example_customers_sync` and `ratelimit_probe` outside the canonical reference contract; do not broaden this change into their delivery redesign.
3. Remove or enabled-module-gate the example entries in `src/lib/homeQuickLinks.ts` (`/example`, `/backend/example`, and `/backend/todos`) so a disabled module never leaves dead navigation.
4. Add `README.md`, `references/surface-map.md`, and `references/surface-inventory.json` inside the existing example tree.
5. Reconcile the current monorepo/template drift, using the monorepo tree as source and reviewing each differing behavior before running the existing sync fixer.
6. Extend `example` only for the missing surfaces identified by the finite inventory. Reuse its existing `Todo`, commands, routes, pages, widgets, and identifiers rather than adding a parallel task domain.
7. Replace large inline examples in standalone skills with exact, line-number-free links to the example source while retaining one normative rule owner per capability.
8. Register `src/modules/example` as a capability-scoped, read-only root in relevant harness cases and prove agents select it before `ratelimit_probe` or undeclared installed-source fallback; declared specialist/host links remain directly usable.
9. Add a whole-harness source-reference manifest and `main`-baseline parity ledger, while also rendering each required reference as a visible direct link in its owning emitted guide, skill, or reference.
10. Turn the Todo DataTable bulk action and platform progress support into one end-to-end canonical example, then add self-contained integration coverage for every new runtime extension introduced by this spec.
11. Add an enum-derived PR #4883 coverage ledger and make every executable example registry statically fact-readable without weakening runtime guards or optional-module behavior.
12. Generate a separate reference-only fact bundle at `.ai/guides/reference-module-facts.json` plus `.ai/guides/reference-modules/example.md` from `src/modules/example`, using portable local source paths and refreshing it during scaffold/`agentic:init`. Normal `.ai/guides/module-facts.json` remains the combined package-module sidecar and `.ai/guides/modules/**` remains the enabled-filtered package Markdown subset; neither normal output receives an app-local `example` entry.
13. Add a PR #4301 design-system reference layer to the example inventory and emitted harness owners: every canonical example UI row names the gallery family/entry, exact installed entry source, public UI import, live route when enabled, preset availability, provenance URL/SHA, and interaction proof.
14. Remove `design_system` from the create-app template registry and assert every built-in generated app marks its gallery reference `source-only`; keep the package source readable and provide a separate activated fixture using `{ id: 'design_system', from: '@open-mercato/core' }`.
15. Give every standalone design-system inventory item a PR #4277 foundation record, retain local `src/app/globals.css` as token truth, optionally emit a deterministic local snapshot/guide only with parity proof, and classify Code Connect/design-tier availability honestly without granting Figma credentials, network access, or manual publish authority.

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

- Byte-identical parity between `apps/mercato/src/modules/example/**` and `packages/create-app/template/src/modules/example/**`.
- Source-presence and registration-absence contracts for `classic`, `empty`, and `crm` scaffolds.
- Removal or registry-gating of example-only home quick links while the module is disabled.
- Progressive-disclosure README, surface map, finite inventory, activation/copy/rename checklist, and exact source links.
- Reuse of the current Todo CRUD/command/UI slice and current UMES/widget/integration examples.
- A reference-quality audit of every file exposed by the capability map; unsafe QA/demo-only files remain present but use `referenceStatus: "qa-only"` and are forbidden to harness reads until remediated.
- Focused additions to `example` for verified gaps such as encryption, explicit data extensions/links, search registration, DI cache use and invalidation, a queued Todo DataTable bulk operation with progress, client notification rendering, translatable-field registration, and default/example seeding.
- Standalone skill links, harness source-selection behavior, bounded example reads, preset tests, sync tests, and activated-fixture validation.
- Whole-harness classification of all emitted knowledge owners, visible exact-file links, prior-`main` topic parity, installed-package target resolution, and dead-link/drift enforcement.
- A Todo DataTable selected-row bulk action that creates a progress job, queues command-mediated work, returns `progressJobId`, and renders operation progress through the existing top progress bar.
- Self-contained activated-fixture integration coverage for every added or materially changed example runtime/discovery extension surface.
- Representative local declarations and callers for every executable PR #4883 module-fact and extension mechanism, with enum-derived classification for framework-owned/reserved/unbound values.
- Local-example reference-fact generation, exact portable `src/modules/example/**` provenance, generated topology/source links, and zero unresolved canonical facts without weakening the existing package-sidecar and enabled-package-Markdown semantics of normal module facts.
- PR #4301 design-system provenance, exact installed gallery-entry links, live-route metadata, and a checked mapping from canonical example UI imports to gallery-covered public `@open-mercato/ui` components.
- Source-present/runtime-disabled `design_system` delivery for every newly generated standalone preset, with explicit activation and route/ACL/gallery QA proof.
- PR #4277 provenance on every design-system item, local token truth plus conditional token-snapshot generation, exact Code Connect references when shipped, and explicit unmapped/placeholder/unavailable/design-tier statuses otherwise.

### Out of Scope

- Adding a separate teaching module, parallel task entity, or duplicate reference-only API/UI tree.
- Enabling `example` or `design_system` by default, or applying example migrations in a newly generated app.
- Treating the entire example tree as code to copy wholesale.
- Removing, renaming, or repurposing `ratelimit_probe`.
- Redesigning `example_customers_sync`; it is not an example-read root.
- Implementing production provider packages, complete workflow engines, broad AI tool packs, model/provider execution, or portal authentication inside `example`. One minimal real Todo-centered declaration per PR #4883 registry/fact kind is in scope; specialist depth remains routed to exact installed sources and skills.
- Expanding issue #4670 beyond the affected certified harness lane.
- Importing from `packages/core/src/modules/design_system/**` inside `example`, importing `example` from the gallery, copying gallery render/snippet code into `example`, or making the PR URL/network availability a runtime dependency.
- Running Figma Variables/Code Connect publish, using `FIGMA_TOKEN`, assuming Organization/Enterprise access, or presenting provisional PR #4277 mappings as merged/certified.

## Canonical Ownership and Synchronization

### Delivery Milestones and Merge Boundaries

This specification is an umbrella contract, not a requirement for one implementation PR. The following milestones are independently reviewable and mergeable while preserving the final invariant:

1. **Canonical delivery:** reconcile the existing tree, add its map/inventory, enforce byte parity, ship it in every preset, and keep it disabled.
2. **Capability gaps:** implement each verified-gap row as a separate vertical slice, including its runtime caller, inventory/source-map entry, exact integration test, dependency metadata, and synchronized mirror. Closely coupled rows may share a PR only when each row remains independently traceable and green.
3. **Harness source-link migration:** classify the whole emitted owner set and prior-`main` ledger, then migrate owner families or coherent topics in independently green batches. This milestone may link existing example/package sources before every capability gap lands; a gap's new links land with that gap or in a later independently green batch.
4. **Certification:** certify each merged milestone with its focused gates, then run the final aggregate packed-scaffold and harness lane once all required milestones are present.

No milestone may temporarily enable `example`, create a shadow reference module, weaken exact-link/read safety, or leave a new runtime/discovery extension without its self-contained integration proof.

### One Authoring Source

The canonical authoring root is:

```text
apps/mercato/src/modules/example/
```

The emitted template mirror is:

```text
packages/create-app/template/src/modules/example/
```

All relative paths, file bytes, and file presence under those roots must match. No template content transform or template-only allowlist entry may target `modules/example/**`. If a difference is necessary for standalone compilation, change the shared source to work in both environments; do not create an exception.

The implementation workflow is:

1. edit and validate the monorepo source;
2. run `yarn template:sync:fix` to materialize the template mirror;
3. review the resulting template diff;
4. run `yarn template:sync` and a focused example-tree parity test; and
5. run monorepo and standalone activated fixtures.

The focused parity test compares sorted relative file lists and SHA-256 content hashes. It also rejects future `TEMPLATE_ONLY_RELATIVE_FILES` or `TEMPLATE_CONTENT_TRANSFORMS` entries under `modules/example/**`. Adding, changing, renaming, or deleting any example file without the exact mirrored change fails the gate.

### Baseline Reconciliation

The implementation must classify each existing differing path before synchronization. Correctness and security changes in the monorepo copy, including tenant/organization scope in Todo command preparation, redo support, and their regression tests, must not be lost. Page-metadata and standalone-compile differences must be resolved into one implementation that works in both trees. The current template-only recovery hint `git checkout -- apps/mercato/src/modules/example/backend/page.tsx` is invalid in a generated app and must become an app-root-relative instruction (or be removed) before the file can be canonical. After reconciliation, the full example subtree is identical; the spec permits no permanent baseline exceptions.

## Reuse Inventory

Implementation starts by recording every row in `references/surface-inventory.json`. Each row has a stable `capabilityId`, one rule owner, a `coverageKind` (`example`, `authoritative-source`, or `specialist-route`), a `referenceStatus` (`canonical` or `qa-only`), a derived `readStatus` (`readable` or `qa-only`), exact source paths, `integrationTestPaths`, and `dependencyModules`. Canonical UI rows also carry `designSystemReferences[]`; each record has `ruleOwnerSourceReferenceId`, `exampleSourceReferenceId`, `galleryCoverage` (`direct` or `composite-not-direct`), one or more `galleryEntries` with `familyId`, `entryId`, public `importPath`, optional `exportName`, exact installed `entrySource`, `gallerySourceReferenceId`, and a non-null `designFoundation`, plus exact installed `implementationSource` and `implementationSourceReferenceId`, optional emitted `localTokenSource` and `localTokenSourceReferenceId`, `availabilityByPreset`, `featureId: "design_system.view"`, `baselinePrUrl`, `provenanceHeadSha`, and merged/package `baselineSha`. A separate derived `designSystemGalleryItems[]` inventory covers every entry in the final packed PR #4301 registry, including entries no canonical example row consumes, and gives each the same non-null PR #4277 envelope. Each `designFoundation` records PR #4277 URL/audited head/final baseline, selected package version/hash, `tokenApplicability` (`local-css` or `not-applicable`), `snapshotAvailability` (`emitted` or `unavailable`), `codeConnectStatus` (`mapped`, `unmapped`, or `not-applicable`), `codeConnectArtifactAvailability` (`installed-packed-auxiliary` or `not-emitted`), `codeConnectExportStatus` (`not-exported` or `exported`), derived `mappingCoverage` (`complete`, `partial`, `none`, `not-applicable`, or `unverified`), `galleryNodeStatus` (`known` or `absent`), `codeConnectNodeStatus` (`known`, `placeholder`, or `absent`), derived `nodeComparison` (`match`, `mismatch`, or `not-comparable`), `publicationStatus: "not-evidenced"`, and `designSkillAvailability` (`emitted-opt-in` or `unavailable`). It carries an exact `snapshotSourceReferenceId` only when the locally generated snapshot was emitted and applicable, an exact `codeConnectSourceReferenceId` only for a verified packed auxiliary mapping file, a normalized `galleryNodeId` only when the gallery node is known, a normalized `codeConnectNodeId` only when the mapping node is known, and a `designSkillSourceReferenceId` only when the portable opt-in skill was actually emitted and selected. `readStatus: "readable"` on a Code Connect record means only that the exact auxiliary source may be read; it never implies a package export, runtime import, live node, or publication. Each gallery entry derives its live route from family/entry; all built-in fresh presets record `source-only`, while only an explicitly activated fixture records `live`. `coverageKind` says where the capability is implemented or routed; `referenceStatus` records reference quality; `readStatus` is the evaluator-facing derivation and is `readable` only for canonical exact files. Repository-only integration tests may be evidence paths but never become readable source references. Every added or materially changed runtime/discovery extension surface with `coverageKind: "example"` requires a non-empty integration-test list even when it is added to an existing capability row. A public UI component taught by a canonical example source maps directly when the merged gallery contains it; an absent composite maps honestly to its exact UI implementation plus checked constituent gallery entries. Missing required visual or implementation coverage blocks canonical status instead of creating a guessed direct reference. `references/surface-map.md` renders the same inventory for humans. Paths have no line anchors.

### Existing Example Surfaces to Reuse

| Capability | Existing source | Required treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Module metadata, ACL, setup, DI, CLI | `index.ts`, `acl.ts`, `setup.ts`, `di.ts`, `cli.ts` | Link to the existing implementation; add one consumed scoped Awilix Todo/cache service because current registry-helper calls do not emit a rich DI registration fact. |
| Entities, validators, custom fields, migration/snapshot | `data/entities.ts`, `data/validators.ts`, `ce.ts`, `migrations/**` | Keep `Todo` as the canonical editable entity and extend its schema/migration rather than introducing a parallel task entity. |
| CRUD factory, Query Engine, OpenAPI, CSV export | `api/todos/route.ts`, `api/openapi.ts`, `components/TodosTable.tsx` | Reuse the live Todo API/list path and close compliance gaps in place. |
| Commands, undo/redo, events/indexer | `commands/todos.ts`, `commands/__tests__/**`, `events.ts`, `subscribers/**` | Preserve scoped command preparation, undo/redo, safe side effects, and typed events; complete optimistic-lock coverage through the gap below. |
| CrudForm/DataTable/perspectives/filters | `backend/todos/**`, `components/TodosTable.tsx` | Extract shared create/edit form definitions only where current pages duplicate them; keep the existing user path. Map these absent composites to their exact UI implementations and checked PR #4301 constituent entries; expose gallery routes only after explicit activation. |
| API/command interceptors, guards, enrichers | `api/interceptors.ts`, `commands/interceptors.ts`, `data/guards.ts`, `data/enrichers.ts` | Retain the real callers/tests, add an exact Todo command target plus explicit custom-route guard and Todo CRUD/query-enricher call sites, and assert every corresponding activation fact. |
| Headless and rendered injection | `widgets/injection/**`, `widgets/injection-table.ts` | Preserve the existing field, column, filter, row/bulk action, menu, customers, catalog, sales, and portal behavior, but normalize the export to a statically readable object whose slots are arrays; optionality moves into entry metadata/feature/module guards. |
| Component replacement and dashboard widgets | `widgets/components.ts`, `widgets/dashboard/**` | Make the component export statically readable, demonstrate `replace`, `wrapper`, and `props` once, and retain dashboard callers/tests. |
| Notification type and reactive handler | `notifications.ts`, `notifications.handlers.ts` | Reuse these owners; add a client renderer only because that discovery surface is absent. |
| Unified overrides | `src/modules.ts`, `__integration__/TC-UMES-022-overrides.spec.ts` | Keep the typed inactive override inventory and its exact test. The source map may link outside the module for the registry entry. |
| Integration coverage | `__integration__/**`, `__tests__/**`, `widgets/__tests__/**`, `lib/__tests__/**` | Preserve and extend focused tests instead of creating a second reference test suite. |

### Verified Gaps to Extend in `example`

The current tree does not have executable owners for the following required reference capabilities. They are additive extensions to `example`, not grounds for a new module:

| Gap | Extension of the current example | Minimum proof |
|---|---|---|
| Progressive source routing | Add `README.md`, `references/surface-map.md`, and `references/surface-inventory.json`. | Link/inventory tests resolve every path in monorepo, template, and emitted layouts. |
| Encryption | Add `encryption.ts`; add one optional sensitive Todo field or module-owned link snapshot and read it through decryption helpers. | Ciphertext-at-rest and no-plaintext-in-search/event/log/cache tests. |
| Explicit extension hosts and entity extensions/links | Add `extension-points.ts`, bind every declaration to a current call site, add `data/extensions.ts`, and only if needed add a module-owned ID/snapshot link entity tied to Todo. | No documentation-only host, no cross-module ORM relation, scoped reads/writes, absent-host behavior. |
| Search registration | Add `search.ts` using the existing `example:todo` identity and non-sensitive fields. | Activated search/index lifecycle and tenant-scope test. |
| Cache | Add a focused DI-resolved Todo read cache with tenant/org tags and post-commit invalidation. | Hit, miss, isolation, and all-write-path invalidation tests. |
| DataTable bulk action, queue, worker, and progress | Give the Todo table `extensionTableId="example.todos.list"`; register `widgets/injection/todo-bulk-complete/widget.ts` at `data-table:example.todos.list:bulk-actions`; add `api/todos/bulk-complete/route.ts`, `lib/todoBulkComplete.ts`, `workers/todos-bulk-dispatch.ts`, and `workers/todos-bulk-complete.ts`. The injected action returns a real `progressJobId`, which is the DataTable path that already tracks the platform top progress bar. Replace the separate synthetic demonstration as the canonical progress reference, although it may remain QA-only. | `TC-EXAMPLE-003-todo-bulk-progress.spec.ts` proves selection, start feedback, visible top progress bar, SSE/poll updates, completion, crash recovery, partial failure, cancellation, retry/idempotency, scope, and record results with `example`, `progress`, `events`, and `scheduler` enabled. |
| Client notification rendering | Add `notifications.client.ts`; reuse `notifications.ts` and `notifications.handlers.ts`. | Renderer registration, audience, dedupe, and cleanup tests. |
| Translatable fields | Add `translations.ts` for applicable Todo text fields. | Generator registration and locale/translation tests. |
| Defaults/example seeds | Extend `setup.ts` with idempotent defaults and opt-in example data. | New-tenant idempotency and no seed while disabled. |
| Shared form definition | Extract a shared Todo create/edit field/group definition from the existing pages when duplication is confirmed. | Both create and edit use it; locking/conflict behavior stays green. |
| Complete optimistic locking | Return `updatedAt` from list/detail projections, pass it through edit `initialValues`, and enforce it in command writes without narrowing legacy schema columns. | Update/delete stale writes return the standard 409 and the unified conflict UI can reload/retry. |
| Standalone override reference | Move or mirror the typed inactive override examples from root `src/modules.ts` into a compileable file under `example/references/` so lean preset registry replacement does not erase the reference. | Every override domain remains typed, inactive, linked, and covered by TC-UMES-022 or its focused successor. |
| Fact-readable registries and bound UI hosts | Refactor `widgets/injection-table.ts` and `widgets/components.ts` to direct statically extractable exports; add real Todo host bindings through `extension-points.ts`; cover every `bound: true` DataTable/CrudForm surface and all three component modes. | Runtime UI assertions plus generated contribution/host/activation facts; optional modules remain safely gated and no `bound: false` surface is faked. |
| Page middleware facts | Add one real backend and one real frontend Todo-route middleware under `backend/middleware.ts` and `frontend/middleware.ts`, using stable IDs and the shared page-middleware contract. | `TC-EXAMPLE-013-page-middleware.spec.ts` proves match/non-match behavior, exact `guards` override targets, and that mutation guards never appear in that domain. |
| AI facts and extensions | Add a small read-only, scoped Todo tool plus `aiToolOverrides` in `ai-tools.ts`; add a read-only agent plus `aiAgentOverrides` and one additive customers-agent `aiAgentExtensions` entry in `ai-agents.ts`; declare/grant the narrow view feature in `acl.ts`/`setup.ts`; do not require an external model call. | Registry discovery, ACL/scope, tool dispatch, distinct agent/tool/file-override/extension fact provenance, and exact `ai.agents`, `ai.tools`, and unkeyed `ai.extensions` override targets. |
| Specialized registry facts | Add a Todo search/vector declaration, one local integration bundle reusing the existing mock adapters, static payment/shipping/currency provider identities, and one minimal Todo workflow triggered by an existing typed event. | Each of the nine specialized registry values is emitted once and its real registration/caller is tested; production provider and workflow-engine depth stays linked to installed sources. |
| Generator-plugin fact | Add `generators.ts` with one deterministic, type-only-import plugin that aggregates the example reference convention into a generated reference index consumed by the local facts/surface-map validation path. | Activated disposable app runs generation twice byte-identically, rejects stale output, proves disabled absence, and resolves portable source links. |
| Portal browser reaction | Mark one non-sensitive Todo event `portalBroadcast: true` and consume it from the existing example portal widget with the supported portal event hook. | Audience/scope/payload tests prove client, portal, and notification-effect transports without adding portal authentication. |

The capability audit must not bless existing code by location alone. Files linked as canonical examples must satisfy current rules: no unscoped lookup, no raw `.json().catch`, no hard-coded status colors, and no `any`-based shortcut where a runtime-narrowed type is possible. Current QA/demo files that do not yet meet that bar remain in the synchronized tree but receive `referenceStatus: "qa-only"` and are denied by `allowedCapabilityIds`; implementation either remediates them before linking or points to a safer exact file. The existing nullable Todo scope columns are a stable schema surface: new writes and queries must require effective tenant/organization scope, but the columns are not narrowed to non-null without a separately approved additive bridge for legacy rows.

The example owns one small real declaration for AI agent/tool/extension, vector, integration/payment/shipping/currency, workflow, and generator-plugin discovery so every PR #4883 fact mechanism is locally inspectable. It does not become the authority for production provider internals, rich workflow orchestration, mutation-capable AI, portal authentication, security providers, analytics, or messages/inbox. Those deeper branches stay `authoritative-source` or `specialist-route`: the byte-identical example README/map records a stable `sourceReferenceId`, while the owning emitted guide/skill/fact sheet renders the visible exact installed-package link. This preserves byte parity and provides both the local minimal mechanism and the correct production-depth reference.

Empty placeholder discovery files are forbidden. If an inventory row is marked `example`, it needs a real registration, caller, and focused test. Additions to or removals from the finite inventory require a spec amendment and compatibility review.

## PR #4301 Design-System Reference Contract

The living gallery and canonical example have different owners. PR #4301's installed `design_system` module visually demonstrates the public component contract; `src/modules/example` demonstrates that same public component in a scoped module workflow. Example code imports only `@open-mercato/ui/...`. It never imports the gallery registry, entry modules, render functions, or snippets at runtime, and the gallery never depends on `example`.

Every UI-bearing implementation topic mapped to a canonical example row renders one adjacent source bundle:

1. the exact canonical example file showing the component in a real module flow;
2. one exact installed gallery entry file under `node_modules/@open-mercato/core/src/modules/design_system/gallery/entries/<family>.tsx` for direct coverage, or the explicitly named constituent entries for `composite-not-direct` coverage;
3. the separately declared exact `node_modules/@open-mercato/ui/src/**` implementation resolved from the entry's public import, plus emitted `src/app/globals.css` only for foundations/tokens; and
4. the after-opt-in path `/backend/design-system?family=<familyId>&entry=<entryId>`; every built-in fresh preset renders an explicit `source-only` marker because `design_system` is unregistered, and only the activated fixture renders it as live.

The owner also renders [PR #4301](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4301) as provenance and records the final packaged SHA, but agents do not need network access to use the reference. Generated gallery records use `referenceRole: "design-system-gallery"` and a shared `visualReference` object matching the inventory fields above. The PR URL, `importPath`, and live route do not grant source-read permission; gallery and implementation IDs each resolve one exact regular installed file through the lockfile-selected package, and the optional token ID resolves only emitted local CSS.

The mapping is exhaustive for canonical example UI, not for every nonvisual helper import or every normative UI topic. A contract test resolves direct example imports to the gallery entry's `importPath` and optional `exportName`, verifies the entry exists in the derived PR #4301 family manifest, verifies its copyable snippet names the same public import, and separately resolves that import to the declared packed UI source. For `composite-not-direct`, it proves no direct merged-gallery entry exists, resolves the exact composite implementation, and validates one or more constituent entries actually used by that implementation without claiming the gallery renders the composite. `CrudForm` and `DataTable` use this composite classification at the merged baseline. A canonical UI row with an unmapped component, false direct claim, stale family/entry/import/SHA, missing packed source, unavailable live route incorrectly marked `live`, workspace-only token path, or gallery-only/internal import fails. Registry/types are discovery references only; gallery coverage/integrity/render/integration tests are QA-only evidence. Unmatched normative topics keep their owning rule guide plus exact UI/gallery sources and do not fabricate an example use. If a desired primitive lacks a gallery entry, update the gallery through its owning module and coverage guard before marking a direct mapping canonical; do not paste the gallery implementation into `example`.

The minimum mapped example families are constituent inputs/forms for `CrudForm`, constituent display/table and filters for `DataTable`, feedback for loading/error/conflict/progress states, overlays for dialogs, navigation/page scaffolding for route shells and form chrome, banners for flash/next-step feedback, notifications for the renderer example, and schedule/messages only where an example surface actually consumes them. This is usage-driven coverage, not a claim that PR #4301 directly showcases `CrudForm`/`DataTable` or a mandate to force every gallery family into Todo.

## PR #4277 Design-Foundation Sidecar Contract

PR #4277 is an optional design/developer-tooling sidecar to the PR #4301 implementation chain, never another runtime hop. “All items” means every entry in the derived PR #4301 gallery inventory—including entries not consumed by the example, direct example entries, and every constituent entry of a composite—has a closed `designFoundation` applicability record and renders the PR URL. It does not mean every unrelated harness case reads Figma tooling or every component has Code Connect coverage. Ordinary backend implementation continues to route through the normative UI owner, exact example use, exact gallery entry/constituents, and exact UI implementation. Only a token/foundation or Figma-facing task follows applicable PR #4277 sources.

Generated `src/app/globals.css` is the sole readable runtime token truth. The audited `.ai/ds/ds-tokens.json`, exporter, health checks, and maintenance README are repository-only governance evidence and cannot be standalone source-reference targets. If implementation chooses to emit a standalone snapshot and `.ai/guides/design-system-foundation.md`, it generates both deterministically from local `src/app/globals.css`, rewrites the snapshot source to that app-local path, proves byte/parity stability, and marks `snapshotAvailability: "emitted"` while retaining `tokenApplicability: "local-css"`; otherwise snapshot availability is `unavailable`. No application code imports the snapshot, exporter, Code Connect files, or design skill.

Code Connect references are allowed only for an exact regular file verified in the final packed `@open-mercato/ui` artifact at `node_modules/@open-mercato/ui/figma/<name>.figma.tsx`. The record uses `referenceRole: "figma-code-connect"`, a package version/hash, immutable read semantics, and no directory, glob, sibling, or transitive permission. Mapping status and coverage are derived from actual `figma.connect` calls joined to a gallery item by exact public import plus export symbol and compared with mapped gallery variants/public component props, not copied counts. Gallery and Code Connect node authorities stay independent: normalize their colon/hyphen forms separately, then derive `nodeComparison`; a gallery node never promotes an unmapped/placeholder Code Connect record, and a Code Connect node never fabricates gallery metadata. Parse/type success does not become publication proof, so the current closed publication value is `not-evidenced`; adding a published state later requires a spec amendment that defines external evidence without granting the harness execution authority.

The validator enforces closed cross-facet tuples. `mapped` requires `installed-packed-auxiliary`, one exact Code Connect source ID, a `known` or `placeholder` Code Connect node, `complete`, `partial`, or provisional `unverified` coverage, and `codeConnectExportStatus` derived as `exported` only when the final package exports that exact auxiliary path and otherwise `not-exported`. `unmapped` requires `not-emitted`, `not-exported`, no Code Connect source/node ID, `codeConnectNodeStatus: "absent"`, and `mappingCoverage: "none"`. `not-applicable` requires no Code Connect source/node ID, `not-emitted`, `not-exported`, absent Code Connect node, and `mappingCoverage: "not-applicable"`. `nodeComparison` is `match` only when both normalized known IDs are equal, `mismatch` only when both are known and unequal, and otherwise `not-comparable`. Snapshot and design-skill source IDs likewise exist only for `emitted` and `emitted-opt-in`; every impossible combination fails generation.

The audited design skill remains unavailable to standalone apps because it is opt-in in the repository and not emitted by create-app. Its current missing reference and inconsistent tier/archetype documentation block promotion to `emitted-opt-in` and any Figma case that requires the skill; they do not block a certified `unavailable` record when no emitted owner/source ID or case depends on it. A record may become `emitted-opt-in` only after a portable standalone copy, local `design` tier, installer/tier/hash checks, complete reference closure, and adapted local links ship; otherwise no case may require or link that owner. `FIGMA_TOKEN`, generated Figma operations reports, REST/plugin writes, Variables application, Code Connect publication, screenshots, and manual node verification remain external QA and never enter normal harness context or execution. Certification re-audits PR #4277's final merged/package SHA and artifact availability; the current open, conflicted head is provenance only.

## PR #4883 Module-Fact and Extension-Topology Contract

`references/surface-inventory.json` gains a generated `factCoverage` ledger. Its finite inputs come from exported `as const` ledgers whose types derive from them, or from named AST extraction plus an exact-literal contract test when the public set is currently type-only; ordinary runtime imports must not pretend erased type aliases exist. Inputs include `ModuleFactSourceKind`, `ModuleOwnedContractKind`, all contribution and activation kinds, host families/capabilities/activation policies, extension-target kinds, all three resolution sets (host, contribution-target, and topology), specialized registries, component modes, `ModuleOverrideDomain`, `ModuleOverrideMode`, `ModuleOverrideTargetNote`, `ModuleOverrideTargetDiagnosticCode`, `ModuleFactDiagnostic['code']`, `ModuleExtensionUnresolvedFact['reason']`, `DATA_TABLE_EXTENSION_SURFACES`, `CRUD_FORM_EXTENSION_SURFACES`, `CRUD_FORM_LIFECYCLE_PHASES`, and `CRUD_FORM_OPERATIONS` at the pinned PR #4883 baseline. Each row records `status`, exact example or framework source, runtime host/caller, generated fact/activation/override-target reference, integration-test IDs, and dependency modules. Allowed statuses are:

- `emitted-example`: real canonical source, runtime registration/caller, generated fact, and activated integration proof;
- `framework-only`: a framework-owned host/catalog fact with an exact installed-package source link and an example contributor/consumer when the mechanism is executable by modules;
- `catalog-only`: typed usage exists but the value is intentionally not an outgoing module contribution;
- `currently-unbound`: the shared catalog explicitly declares `bound: false`, so no runtime example is fabricated; and
- `negative-fixture`: a public resolution or diagnostic value exercised by a malformed/broken generator fixture and forbidden in activated canonical output.

An enum value missing from the ledger, a changed enum without an explicit row, an `emitted-example` row without a generated fact or test, or a catalog status used to hide an executable ordinary-module mechanism fails generation.

### Required Fact Families

| Finite set | Required canonical coverage |
|---|---|
| `ModuleFactSourceKind` | Every source kind is represented with exact portable provenance or a deterministic `factRef` to the rich fact that owns it. Existing module metadata, entity, event, ACL feature, API route, DI, search, notification, CLI command, backend page, frontend page, command, subscriber, setup, custom entity, extension host, and extension contribution sources are retained; worker, vector, AI tool/agent/extension, page middleware, encryption, integration, and generator-plugin gaps land in the rows above. Each `(kind, id)` resolves through exactly one direct source or fact reference, never neither or both. |
| `ModuleOwnedContractKind` | All ten kinds (`module-metadata`, `command`, `worker`, `page-middleware`, `setup`, `encryption`, `di-registration`, `custom-entity`, `ai-extension`, `generator-plugin`) appear under `example.ownedContracts` with no unresolved diagnostics. |
| Specialized registries | `notification`, `integration`, `search`, `vector`, `ai`, `payment`, `shipping`, `currency`, and `workflow` each have one real Todo/example-centered declaration and fact. Existing mock adapters are reused; no production provider is reimplemented. |
| Unified override targets | Every example-owned nested override host emits `domain`, full `path`, optional `key` only for keyed records, `modes[]`, `factRef`, `source`, and applicable closed `notes`, and round-trips through the runtime resolver. Required nested hosts include `ai.agents/tools/extensions`, `routes.api/pages`, `widgets.injection/components/dashboard`, `notifications.types/handlers`, interceptors, command interceptors, enrichers, page-middleware `guards`, CLI, ACL, DI, encryption, workers/events, and all setup paths (`defaultRoleFeatures`, `defaultCustomerRoleFeatures`, `seedDefaults`, `seedExamples`, `onTenantCreated`). Framework-only `nav.groupOrder` has no fake example target. |
| Override taxonomy | All 16 runtime domains (`ai`, `routes`, `events`, `workers`, `widgets`, `notifications`, `interceptors`, `commandInterceptors`, `enrichers`, `guards`, `cli`, `setup`, `acl`, `di`, `encryption`, `nav`) are classified; `nav` is framework-only. All three modes (`disable-replace`, `replace`, `additive`) and both closed notes (`safe-metadata-only`, `page-middleware-not-mutation-guard`) are exercised. Add `unknown-framework-mode` to the closed `ModuleOverrideTargetDiagnosticCode` set: an unknown framework mode emits that diagnostic and no guessed target. |

The DI row must be a real Awilix `container.register` entry (the scoped Todo/reference cache service consumed by a route), not merely a call to an external adapter registry. Facts expose token, registration kind, lifetime, injection mode, and provider symbol only; they never expose values or function bodies.

### Required Extension Topology

| Finite set | Required canonical coverage |
|---|---|
| Contribution kinds | Emit and execute `widget`, `data-table`, `crud-form`, `component-override`, `response-enricher`, `api-interceptor`, `command-interceptor`, `mutation-guard`, `entity-extension`, `subscriber`, `browser-reaction`, and `specialized-registry`. `module-override` is `catalog-only`: app-owned inactive typed usage and exact `overrideTargets` prove it without falsely attributing app configuration as an outgoing module contribution. |
| Activation kinds | Generated activated-example facts include all eight: `crud-response-enricher`, `query-enricher`, `mutation-guard`, `api-interceptor-bridge`, `command-interceptor-bridge`, `widget-injection-consumer`, `component-extension-consumer`, and `dashboard-host-consumer`. Each points to a real caller/host. |
| Target kinds | Cover `module`, `entity`, `api-route`, exact `command`, `widget-spot`, `component`, `event`, `notification`, and `wildcard`. The exact Todo command interceptor supplies the command target; broken targets are never added for enum coverage. |
| Host resolution | Demonstrate `exact`, `pattern`, `framework`, and `fact-ref` host identities with their real owners and callers. |
| Contribution-target resolution | Demonstrate `exact`, `pattern`, `framework`, `fact-ref`, and `optional-external`; classify `unresolved` as `negative-fixture` and exercise it only in a broken-target generator fixture. |
| Topology resolution | Demonstrate `bound`, `capability-only`, `optional-target-missing`, and `wildcard`; activated canonical-example output has zero `unresolved`. Classify `unresolved` and the closed unresolved/duplicate diagnostic reasons as `negative-fixture`. Incoming rows are asserted only for cross-module bindings; self-targets remain intentionally absent. |
| Host activation | Demonstrate `always`, `host-opt-in`, `caller-opt-in`, and `feature-gated` through real declarations and callers. |
| Host families/capabilities | Every exported family and capability maps to either an executable example declaration/contribution/consumer or an exact framework-owned host link. `generic`/headless mutation, menus, DataTable, CrudForm, detail, portal, component, entity, API, command, event, query lifecycle, dashboard, notification, integration, specialized registry, and module override are all explicit in the ledger. |

The example covers every discriminant explicitly enumerated here rather than every Cartesian combination. It covers widget payloads (`render`, `headless`, `menu`, `dashboard`, `notification`, `integration`), DataTable payloads (`column`, `row-action`, `bulk-action`, `filter`, `toolbar`, `render`), CrudForm payloads (`render`, `field`, `lifecycle-handler`), component modes (`replace`, `wrapper`, `props`), widget/DataTable execution guards (`host`, `contribution`, `both`), API activation modes (`crud-pipeline`, `custom-route-bridge`), response-enricher list/detail plus a real query-engine pass, API before/after, command execute/undo phases, mutation-guard block/rewrite/after-success with optimistic locking preserved, sync/async subscribers, and client/portal/notification-effect browser transports. The CrudForm lifecycle example covers all 14 exported phases, including all four delete phases, and all three operations (`create`, `update`, `delete`). Other detail-field unions are still ledgered and classified but need representative combinations only where they change runtime behavior.

### Bound UI Surface Matrix

Every currently bound host surface has a fact-readable registration and a runtime test:

- DataTable: `header`, `footer`, `toolbar`, `searchTrailing`, `columns`, `rowActions`, `bulkActions`, `filters`, and `replacement`;
- CrudForm: `base`, `header`, `fields`, and `replacement`.

The catalog-declared unbound surfaces remain `currently-unbound`: DataTable `emptyState`; CrudForm `beforeFields`, `afterFields`, `footer`, `sidebar`, `group`, `fieldBefore`, and `fieldAfter`. The README links their exact framework declarations and says they are unavailable; it does not present fake code or claim integration coverage.

### Static Extraction and Correlation Prerequisites

The example and PR #4883 readers must meet before certification:

1. `injectionTable` is a direct static object and every slot is an array; `componentOverrides` is a direct static array. Conditional inclusion moves to supported metadata, required-module, and feature guards.
2. Injection extraction preserves widget/DataTable/CrudForm payload kinds, including headless/menu/notification/integration, toolbar, and lifecycle-handler, rather than collapsing all entries to render.
3. Component facts read the runtime `propsTransform` contract and emit all three modes.
4. Dashboard contributions bind patterned framework hosts and classify as `dashboard-host-consumer` before the generic widget activation; all eight activation kinds must be reachable.
5. `module-override` has an exhaustive `catalog-only` extraction classification so the public contribution union cannot be mistaken for 13 emitted source conventions.
6. The Todo CRUD route exposes literal response/query enricher call sites; the planned bulk custom route invokes the shared mutation-guard bridge; the command interceptor includes exact `example.todos.update`; declared hosts are referenced from the real Todo DataTable, CrudForm, injection spot/pattern, and replaceable component.
7. Page facts use the runtime companion resolver for `page.meta.ts` / `meta.ts` and retain the supported metadata aliases; the existing Todo page companion is a parity fixture.
8. Worker facts cover root and nested workers, including one id-less worker whose fallback ID and locally declared queue exactly match runtime derivation.
9. Query-enricher activation requires `queryEngine.enabled === true`; explicit false and absent configuration remain response-only negative fixtures.
10. API-interceptor activation derives from a real CRUD or explicit custom-route bridge and preserves HTTP method and before/after phase; no-bridge, after-only, and method-mismatch fixtures cannot report a false binding.
11. Mutation-guard activation recognizes the canonical `runRouteMutationGuards` / `input.resourceKind` shape and verified wrappers, and correlates compatible operations rather than entity kind alone.
12. AI facts distinguish `aiAgentOverrides`, `aiToolOverrides`, and additive `aiAgentExtensions`; notification facts and override targets include both types and handlers; setup facts include both staff and customer default-role profiles.
13. Unknown framework override modes emit the required new `unknown-framework-mode` override-target diagnostic; missing source/fact references, duplicate IDs, and unsupported dynamic keys emit their closed fact/extension diagnostics rather than guessed targets. Every code/reason is ledgered, with malformed-only values classified `negative-fixture`.

These are fail-fast compatibility requirements, not excuses to weaken the coverage ledger. If PR #4883 changes before implementation, regenerate the enum input and amend this spec rather than pinning stale counts.

Certification is blocked until the reviewed #4883 reader gaps above are fixed or receive an explicit non-executable classification that agrees with runtime. In particular, `notifications.handlers`, AI agent/tool file overrides, customer-role setup profiles, id-less workers, sibling page metadata, method/phase-aware interceptor bridges, operation-aware mutation guards, and configuration-aware query enrichers cannot be omitted merely because the current adapter misses them.

### Local Example Reference-Fact Generation

Normal `.ai/guides/module-facts.json` remains the combined package-provided module sidecar copied as-is, while `.ai/guides/modules/**` remains the enabled-filtered subset of package Markdown sheets. App-local modules are outside both normal outputs today, whether enabled or disabled; this spec does not silently redefine either contract. A local `example` must never be late-merged into the package sidecar, receive `bound` activations there, or appear as an exact live override target. Instead, create-app and `mercato agentic:init` generate `.ai/guides/reference-module-facts.json` and `.ai/guides/reference-modules/example.md`. The JSON has an exact top-level `example` object with `moduleId: "example"`, `projectionKind: "activated-reference"`, `sourceKind: "local-reference"`, `runtimeSelected: false`, `sourceFingerprint`, `taxonomyFingerprint`, and nested `facts` produced by the normal extractor from an explicitly activated disposable selection context. The Markdown heading states that activations and override targets describe behavior only after opt-in. An activated fixture compares that nested value with a fresh activated app-local extraction result; it does not require or mutate either normal generated artifact.

Add explicit `portableSourceRoot` and `sourceKind: "local-reference"` extractor/render inputs so local extraction emits `src/modules/example`, never `node_modules/@app/**` or `node_modules/@open-mercato/core/**`. Do not reinterpret `sourcePackage: null`, which remains the legacy core-package signal; the renderer uses the explicit source kind to emit `generated from local reference src/modules/example` plus the two fingerprints. The local reference source is appended before the same `extractAllModuleFacts` selection/correlation batch used for the activated disposable context; a post-correlation object merge is forbidden because it would lose incoming and optional-target resolution. Reject a duplicate module ID before assignment. Define `sourceFingerprint` as SHA-256 of canonical JSON for the array of `{ path, sha256 }` records sorted by path. Define `taxonomyFingerprint` as SHA-256 of canonical JSON for `{ setName, value }` records sorted by set name and canonicalized value; `value` contains the complete literal or structured entry (including key, suffix, capabilities, `bound`, phases, and operations), object keys are recursively sorted, and semantically set-valued arrays are sorted. Delimiter-concatenated tuples are forbidden.

The template build extracts `packages/create-app/template/src/modules/example`; scaffold setup and `mercato agentic:init` recompute from the generated app's local `src/modules/example`. A stale package-only reference, missing reference Markdown/JSON, accidental app-local entry in the normal package sidecar or package Markdown subset, duplicate module key, non-portable path, source body/value leakage, wrong projection/source/selection marker, or mismatch among authoring/template/emitted reference facts fails create-app build, all preset fixtures, and `agentic:init`. Generated reference Markdown renders exact local file links relative to `.ai/guides/reference-modules/`; it never points at a workspace-only authoring path. No other disabled module receives a reference projection implicitly.

## Disabled-by-Default Delivery Contract

Every built-in `classic`, `empty`, and `crm` scaffold must satisfy all assertions:

1. the emittable `src/modules/example/**` runtime/reference file set is present and byte-identical to the canonical tree after the scaffold's existing `__tests__`/`__integration__` filter; and
2. `src/modules.ts` contains no enabled entry with `id: 'example'`; and
3. `src/modules.ts` contains no enabled entry with `id: 'design_system'`, while the installed `@open-mercato/core` artifact still contains the exact gallery source required by the harness.

Consequently neither reference module contributes a runtime surface until explicitly enabled. The local example source still participates in TypeScript compilation, so it must compile with the dependencies installed by every built-in preset. One fixture opts in to `{ id: 'example', from: '@app' }`, runs `yarn generate`, verifies `E.example.todo === 'example:todo'`, and exercises the Todo list/create/edit/delete paths without applying migrations to a developer database. A separate fixture opts in to `{ id: 'design_system', from: '@open-mercato/core' }`, runs generation, grants `design_system.view`, and exercises the gallery route/ACL/search/deep-link/accessibility/copy/dark-mode contract; it must not enable `example` merely to render the gallery.

This intentionally changes the fresh `classic` scaffold's `example` and the PR #4301 template's `design_system` defaults from enabled to disabled. Existing applications and the monorepo development app are not rewritten. Preset and snapshot tests must make the new-app boundary explicit and prove the generated home/sidebar contains no dead example or design-system link. `ratelimit_probe` behavior stays unchanged. `example_customers_sync` remains outside this spec and must never be activated merely because the example source is present.

## Data, API, UI, and Runtime Contracts

The existing `Todo` slice is the reference entity. Extensions preserve `example`, `Todo`, `example:todo`, the current table/API paths, ACL IDs, events, widget IDs, and integration-test identifiers. Renaming those surfaces for a shadow module or creating parallel IDs is forbidden.

Any added user-editable field keeps `updated_at`/`updatedAt` and the default optimistic-lock contract. Todo create/update/delete and any child/link mutation stay command-mediated, tenant/organization scoped, Zod-validated, undoable where supported, and use the child record's version when a child mutation overrides the parent header. No decrypted or cross-module display value enters events, logs, cache, search, or notification payloads.

Existing pages remain the UI reference. Lists use `DataTable`; create/edit use `CrudForm`; HTTP uses the shared API helpers; non-`CrudForm` writes use `useGuardedMutation`; conflicts use the unified conflict surface. New UI uses translations, semantic design tokens, shared loading/error/empty components, keyboard behavior, and accessible labels. Extensions must not enlarge an already oversized page merely to demonstrate another surface; add a focused component and link it from the map.

The Todo list's canonical long-operation path is an `InjectionBulkActionDefinition`, not the host-owned `bulkActions` prop path, because the existing injected-action result contract consumes `progressJobId`, tracks terminal events, clears selection, and refreshes on completion. `TodosTable` declares `extensionTableId="example.todos.list"`; `widgets/injection-table.ts` registers action ID `example.todos.mark-done` from `widgets/injection/todo-bulk-complete/widget.ts` at `data-table:example.todos.list:bulk-actions`.

The action creates one UUID `idempotencyKey` per invocation and POSTs `{ ids, idempotencyKey }` to `api/todos/bulk-complete/route.ts`; `ids` is a unique array of 1–500 UUIDs. Add module-owned `TodoBulkOperation` in `data/entities.ts` with `tenant_id`, non-null `organization_id`, `user_id`, `idempotency_key`, request hash, selected IDs, `progress_job_id` as a plain UUID (no cross-module ORM relation), publish state/attempt timestamps, execution state/lease owner/lease expiry, next-item checkpoint, bounded result summary, and timestamps; its migration has a unique constraint on `(tenant_id, organization_id, user_id, idempotency_key)`. The route requires the existing Todo manage feature, derives scope from authenticated server context, verifies every selected ID in that scope before starting, and uses one transaction/unique-constraint claim helper in `lib/todoBulkComplete.ts` to create or reuse the operation and progress job. Duplicate requests return the recorded `progressJobId` and may safely nudge publication recovery; they never create a second logical operation/progress job.

`TodoBulkOperation` is also the module-owned transactional outbox. After commit, the route calls the shared dispatcher for low latency. `setup.ts` registers an idempotent organization-scoped scheduler target for `example:todos-bulk-dispatch`; `workers/todos-bulk-dispatch.ts` scans scoped unpublished operations and expired execution leases, enqueues only `{ operationId, scope }` on `example-todos-bulk-complete`, and records publish attempts. Publication is explicitly at least once: a crash after queue acceptance but before marking published may create two physical queue messages, and this is safe because the leased execution claim below permits one effective executor. A crash before publication leaves the durable row pending for the next scheduler tick or same-key request. The API returns HTTP 202 `{ ok: true, progressJobId }` after the durable row/job commit; an immediate enqueue failure does not erase it. Malformed, repeated IDs, missing, foreign-scope, or unauthorized input creates neither row nor job.

Worker `example:todos-bulk-complete` acquires or renews a compare-and-swap lease on the operation (the same queue job may renew; another job waits until expiry), resumes from `nextItemIndex`, calls `startJob`, checks `isCancellationRequested()` before every item, loads the current scoped Todo version, and executes existing command ID `example.todos.update` with `is_done: true` and that record's optimistic-lock version. Already-completed Todos are idempotent successes. After every attempted item it atomically advances the checkpoint, persists bounded result codes, renews the lease, and updates progress. A cancellation request stops before the next command and calls `markCancelled`; zero successful mutations with failures calls `failJob`; mixed success/failure calls `completeJob` with `{ affectedCount, failedCount, failedItems: [{ id, code }] }`; full success calls `completeJob`. Terminal CAS clears the lease and makes duplicate messages no-ops. A mid-worker crash is recovered by the queue retry with the same lease owner or by the dispatcher after lease expiry, preserving the same operation/progress job and checkpoint. The activated fixture provisions the least required example mutation features plus `progress.view` and the server-side progress create/update/cancel capabilities; the browser never receives broader progress management merely to make the bar appear. Client-side write loops, timers that simulate progress, the host-owned bulk-action prop, or a page-local progress widget do not satisfy this reference capability.

Optional customers, catalog, sales, and portal hosts degrade gracefully. The example never gains a hard `requires` dependency or cross-module ORM relationship. All cross-module contributions retain stable typed context, ACL checks, tenant/organization scope, and absent-host tests.

### Frontend Architecture Contract

The implementation keeps route roots server-rendered by default and puts browser behavior in bounded client islands:

| Route / surface | Server root | Client island | Data owner / boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/backend/todos` | `backend/todos/page.tsx` | `components/TodosTable.tsx` | Existing scoped Todo API and React Query; the route root adds no client directive. |
| `/backend/todos/create` | `backend/todos/create/page.tsx` after extraction | `backend/todos/create/TodoCreateForm.tsx` | `CrudForm` plus shared form definition; the page supplies server-safe shell/metadata only. |
| `/backend/todos/[id]/edit` | `backend/todos/[id]/edit/page.tsx` after extraction | `backend/todos/[id]/edit/TodoEditForm.tsx` | Scoped detail load, `CrudForm`, optimistic-lock conflict/retry; no page-root client blob. |
| Injected Todo bulk action | Existing DataTable host | `widgets/injection/todo-bulk-complete/widget.client.tsx` loaded by the data-only `widget.ts` registration | `apiCall` + `useGuardedMutation`; returned `progressJobId` is handed to the DataTable/top-bar contract. |
| Portal Todo reaction | Existing portal page host | Existing focused portal widget client leaf | `useAppEvent`/supported portal event hook; no portal-wide provider or auth change. |
| Bound host/component examples | Existing server/page hosts | Focused widget/component client leaves only where hooks or DOM behavior require them | Static registrations stay server/build readable; optional module and feature guards execute at the supported host/contribution boundary. |

The `"use client"` ledger is finite: existing `components/TodosTable.tsx` remains a client island for table/query state; new `TodoCreateForm.tsx` and `TodoEditForm.tsx` own interactive forms/router/conflict state; `todo-bulk-complete/widget.client.tsx` owns selected-row mutation state; and the portal/browser-reaction leaf owns its event subscription cleanup. No other new page root or shared provider receives `"use client"`. `TodosTable.tsx` is already over 300 lines; the only permitted touch is the stable host ID/prop wiring. If the slice needs additional table logic, extract a focused leaf in the same change rather than growing that file. Every new client leaf targets at most 200 lines and imports no editor/chart/calendar/graph/browser SDK.

| Budget | Required value |
|---|---|
| New client page roots | 0 |
| New/touched client leaves over 300 LOC | 0; the existing `TodosTable.tsx` exception is host-prop-only as described above |
| Heavy browser library or global provider additions | 0 |
| Changed-route hydration smoke | Required for todos list/create/edit and every newly executable injected UI surface |
| Runtime/build evidence | `yarn check:client-boundaries` plus `yarn build:app`; capture a route-level Playwright hydration/interaction result for list, forms, bulk progress, and portal reaction |

No global provider/bootstrap registry changes are allowed for this UI work. Static module/widget registries remain build-time or route-scoped; any discovered need for a global provider is an architecture change that requires maintainer approval and a spec amendment. Tests cover hydration, selected-row start/progress/completion, create/edit/delete/conflict keyboard flows, widget cleanup, optional-host absence, and browser-console errors.

Component selection follows the PR #4301 gallery mapping in `references/surface-inventory.json`. Each client island imports the mapped public `@open-mercato/ui` component used by its gallery entry; new example UI must use that shipped component instead of recreating a bespoke equivalent when the gallery covers the need. Focused module glue/layout is allowed, but it does not copy the entry's render function/snippet or import `design_system`. Reviewers can open the adjacent gallery deep link to inspect live variants, then inspect the exact example source for production integration.

## Standalone Skill-to-Example Contract

The standalone `om-module-scaffold`, `om-system-extension`, `om-backend-ui-design`, `om-data-model-design`, `om-eject-and-customize`, and harness-evolution guidance must route to the exact relevant files under `src/modules/example/**`.

Each rule has one owner:

- skills/guides own requirements and decision rules;
- `example` owns compiling executable examples;
- `surface-inventory.json` owns the finite machine-readable mapping; and
- `surface-map.md` owns the human navigation view.

Skills must tell agents to copy or adapt only the necessary files and rename module/entity/route/event/widget/ACL identifiers. Large duplicated snippets move to source links. Short syntax fragments may remain when they express a rule rather than an implementation. Tests reject dead links, directory-only links, line anchors, duplicate owners, missing emitted skills, and any instruction to use `ratelimit_probe` as a blueprint.

## Whole-Harness Direct Source-Link Contract

The implementation inventories every emitted text knowledge owner, not just case context: root `AGENTS.md` and provider/editor wrappers or rules; all `.ai/guides/*.md`; every installed local skill entrypoint/reference; spec templates, tracker descriptors, review/QA guidance, harness README/release/case/oracle descriptions; generated module fact sheets/upstream snapshots; and any other emitted Markdown/template/rule file that can direct implementation. Operational owners such as the root safety/router, delivery workflow tables, report templates, versioned upgrade instructions, tracker commands, harness execution procedure, and enforcement hooks may be classified `self-authoritative`; generated identifiers may be classified `generated-fact`. Every other implementation-bearing topic is `source-required` and must show at least one visible Markdown link to an exact regular file in its declared current owner. A backticked path, directory link, wildcard, manifest-only record, or evaluator allowance is not a visible source link.

The controller generates `packages/create-app/agentic/shared/ai/harness/source-link-inventory.json`, emitted as `.ai/harness/source-link-inventory.json`, from the complete emitted owner scan, canonical example inventory, generated module-fact provenance, PR #4301 design-system mappings, PR #4277 per-item applicability, case/oracle references, package/preset matrix, and the checked `main` parity ledger. It is a derived asset and must never be hand-edited or treated as an independent authority. Each record contains `topicId`, emitted `originAsset`, optional heading/anchor, `requirement` (`source-required`, `self-authoritative`, `generated-fact`, or `retained-normative-snippet`), `targetKind` (`canonical-example`, `installed-package`, or `local-owner`), `readStatus` (`readable` or `qa-only`), exact owner-relative rendered `href`, logical app-root `resolvedPath`, capability/module/package IDs, installed version and content hash where applicable, preset/tier applicability, integration-test evidence paths, affected case IDs, and the `main` baseline IDs it replaces. PR #4301 gallery and UI-implementation records additionally carry `referenceRole: "design-system-gallery"` and the same `visualReference` with direct/composite coverage, gallery-entry array, import, after-opt-in routes, source-only availability, feature, provenance head, and merged/package baseline. Every gallery-entry record also carries the closed PR #4277 `designFoundation` sidecar above and visible provenance URL; exact Code Connect, emitted snapshot, or design-skill IDs exist only when their packed/emitted/tier preconditions pass. The controller derives gallery and Code Connect sets, imports, variants, node status, and coverage from final packed sources; it never copies family counts, mapping counts, or coverage allowlists into the manifest. The controller computes each owner-relative `href` from `originAsset` plus logical `resolvedPath`; mirrored example files therefore keep only app-root-stable local links/reference IDs, while location-specific installed-package hrefs live in generated owners outside the synchronized tree. The manifest is a completeness/drift oracle; it never substitutes for the link rendered in `originAsset`. Cases may cite only records with `readStatus: "readable"`; QA-only test evidence cannot grant source reads, and visual/provenance metadata never grants a file or network read.

Add checked `packages/create-app/agentic/shared/ai/harness/source-link-baseline.json` plus `source-link-baseline.schema.json` for the resolved `main` audit. The root object has the exact 40-hex `baselineSha`, the exact `baselineAssets` table below, and `blocks`. Each asset record contains `path`, full-file `sha256`, and `expectedFenceCount`. Every block has stable ID `main:<asset>#fence:<ordinal>`, `asset`, nearest `heading`, one-based asset `ordinal`, opening line, fence info string, content `sha256`, `topicIds` (empty only for `not-implementation`), and one disposition: `linked`, `retained-normative-snippet`, `superseded-with-current-rule-and-source`, or `not-implementation`. `linked` and `superseded-with-current-rule-and-source` require non-empty `targetTopicIds` that resolve exactly to source-link inventory topics. `retained-normative-snippet`, `superseded-with-current-rule-and-source`, and `not-implementation` require a checked non-empty `rationale`; `linked` may omit it. IDs are unique. The validator loads exactly the eight pinned files, verifies each full-file hash, parses every CommonMark backtick/tilde fence including fences indented by up to three spaces, derives IDs/positions/hashes, requires exactly the per-asset count and 136 one-to-one block records, and rejects a missing/substituted asset, missing/extra/hash-mismatched fence, unresolved target topic, or conditionally missing field. Semantically duplicate blocks may map to the same compiling file, and short invariant syntax may stay inline, but no old topic may disappear merely because new prose mentions the concept.

| **Total** |  | **136** |

The eight owner families and source strategy are:

| Emitted owner family | Prior implementation coverage | Required visible source strategy |
|---|---|---|
| Root instructions | Module anatomy, locking, common imports | Keep the root a budget-safe safety/router owner with one compact visible README/inventory entrypoint; map the old detailed topics to exact links in the selected architecture/contracts/UI owners rather than restoring them in root. |
| `om-backend-ui-design` and backend UI guide/references | Page shell, DataTable, CrudForm, dialogs, detail/states/API/custom fields | Keep emitted UI guidance as normative owner; link the exact example integration, one PR #4301 gallery entry for visual usage, the separately declared exact installed UI implementation, and local emitted token CSS when relevant. PR #4277 remains a classified sidecar unless the task is token/Figma-facing. |
| Optional design/Figma owner | Token foundations and Figma-facing component mapping | Use the portable `om-figma-design-with-ds` owner only when it is actually emitted and selected in a local `design` tier; link local token truth and an exact packed Code Connect file when applicable, while retaining the PR #4301 gallery/UI implementation chain. |
| `om-data-model-design` | Entities, relations, queries, validators, migrations, locking, encryption | Link exact example data/command/migration/encryption files; use an installed module source for relation/helper patterns the example intentionally does not implement. |
| `om-eject-and-customize` | Safe installed-module modification | Link the exact framework-context-resolved installed file plus the example migration/entity mechanics; never a package directory. |
| `om-integration-builder` | Registration, adapters, webhooks, health, widgets, tests | Link exact installed provider/hub source shipped in the applicable preset and exact local mock-adapter files only where they are reference-quality. |
| `om-module-scaffold` | Complete CRUD/module vertical slice | Link exact capability files in `src/modules/example`, starting from its README/map. |
| `om-system-extension` | Enrichers, interceptors, guards, injections, row/bulk actions, subscribers, overrides | Link exact example UMES contributor/caller/test files and exact generated host-source files. |
| `om-troubleshooter` | Discovery, database/API/extension diagnostics, page metadata repair | Link exact app scripts/config/tests/page metadata or a version-resolved installed defect call site. |

Generated fact sheets also stop rendering unreadable source-root directory links. Every entity, API/page route, event, ACL feature, DI key, search/notification surface, extension host, and UMES contribution that advertises source provenance renders an exact-file link when the extractor knows it. Roots and patterns may remain non-clickable explanatory text only. Existing extractor `source` fields must be rendered rather than discarded.

### Minimum Direct Targets

The emitted links use paths relative to their emitted owner. The table below pins the minimum app-root targets and links their current authoring equivalents for review:

| Capability | Emitted exact target(s) | Current authoring evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Todo CRUD/DataTable | `src/modules/example/api/todos/route.ts`, `src/modules/example/components/TodosTable.tsx`, `src/modules/example/backend/todos/create/page.tsx`, `src/modules/example/backend/todos/[id]/edit/page.tsx` | [CRUD route](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/api/todos/route.ts), [Todo table](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/components/TodosTable.tsx), [create page](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/backend/todos/create/page.tsx), [edit page](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/backend/todos/[id]/edit/page.tsx) |
| Design-system gallery | One direct or checked constituent `node_modules/@open-mercato/core/src/modules/design_system/gallery/entries/<family>.tsx`, the separately declared exact `node_modules/@open-mercato/ui/src/**` implementation, and optional local `src/app/globals.css`; `.../gallery/{registry,types}.ts` are discovery-only; adjacent after-opt-in route `/backend/design-system?family=<familyId>&entry=<entryId>` | [PR #4301](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4301), with source paths derived from merged/package commit `bf25803d7a8c85c8552db9e76c7cc4398d1768be` rather than copied snippets |
| Design foundation | Local `src/app/globals.css` for token truth; exact role-gated `node_modules/@open-mercato/ui/figma/<name>.figma.tsx` only for a final packed mapping; emitted `.ai/ds/ds-tokens.json` / `.ai/guides/design-system-foundation.md` and opt-in design skill only when their emission/tier contracts ship | [PR #4277](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4277) at provisional audited head `fb9b8ddfe4470ef11d312caa4628c46af7d48adf`; final merged/package SHA is mandatory before certification |
| DataTable bulk action and global progress | `src/modules/example/components/TodosTable.tsx`, `src/modules/example/widgets/injection/todo-bulk-complete/widget.ts`, `src/modules/example/api/todos/bulk-complete/route.ts`, `src/modules/example/lib/todoBulkComplete.ts`, `src/modules/example/workers/todos-bulk-dispatch.ts`, `src/modules/example/workers/todos-bulk-complete.ts`, `node_modules/@open-mercato/ui/src/backend/DataTable.tsx`, `node_modules/@open-mercato/ui/src/backend/progress/ProgressTopBar.tsx` | [existing injected bulk action](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/widgets/injection/customer-priority-bulk-actions/widget.ts), [current separate progress demo](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/backend/umes-next-phases/page.tsx), [DataTable progress contract](../../packages/ui/src/backend/DataTable.tsx), [top progress bar](../../packages/ui/src/backend/progress/ProgressTopBar.tsx), [production bulk worker precedent](../../packages/core/src/modules/customers/lib/bulkDeals.ts) |
| Data/commands/locking | `src/modules/example/data/entities.ts`, `src/modules/example/data/validators.ts`, `src/modules/example/commands/todos.ts`, an exact migration file | [entities](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/data/entities.ts), [validators](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/data/validators.ts), [commands](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/commands/todos.ts) |
| UMES | Exact example `api/interceptors.ts`, `commands/interceptors.ts`, `data/{guards,enrichers,extensions}.ts`, `widgets/injection-table.ts`, individual widget files, `widgets/components.ts`, and subscriber files | [API interceptors](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/api/interceptors.ts), [guards](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/data/guards.ts), [enrichers](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/data/enrichers.ts), [injection table](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/widgets/injection-table.ts), [component replacements](../../apps/mercato/src/modules/example/widgets/components.ts) |
| Module facts and topology | `.ai/guides/reference-module-facts.json`, `.ai/guides/reference-modules/example.md`, `src/modules/example/references/surface-inventory.json`, `src/modules/example/extension-points.ts`, `src/modules/example/widgets/injection-table.ts`, and each exact fact source named there; normal `.ai/guides/module-facts.json` and enabled-filtered package Markdown are negative compatibility assertions for app-local exclusion | [PR #4883 extension extractor](../../packages/cli/src/lib/generators/module-extension-facts.ts), [module-facts generator](../../packages/cli/src/lib/generators/module-facts.ts), [shared extension catalog](../../packages/shared/src/modules/widgets/extension-points.ts) |
| Specialist provider | Exact files such as `node_modules/@open-mercato/gateway-stripe/src/modules/gateway_stripe/integration.ts` and `.../lib/webhook-handler.ts`; only in presets/tiers that install the package | [Stripe registration](../../packages/gateway-stripe/src/modules/gateway_stripe/integration.ts), [webhook handler](../../packages/gateway-stripe/src/modules/gateway_stripe/lib/webhook-handler.ts) |
| AI/workflow specialist | Exact files such as `node_modules/@open-mercato/core/src/modules/customers/ai-agents.ts`, `.../ai-tools.ts`, and `.../workflows/lib/workflow-executor.ts` | [customer agent](../../packages/core/src/modules/customers/ai-agents.ts), [customer tools](../../packages/core/src/modules/customers/ai-tools.ts), [workflow executor](../../packages/core/src/modules/workflows/lib/workflow-executor.ts) |

Installed-package links are first-class declared references, not `installedVersionFallback`. They are permitted only when the target is present in the actual packed artifact for every applicable preset/tier, the package is selected through the app's lockfile/module registry, and the link resolves under that selected package's `src/**` to a regular read-only file. The sole non-`src` exception is one exact packed regular `node_modules/@open-mercato/ui/figma/<name>.figma.tsx` target with `referenceRole: "figma-code-connect"`, an applicable Figma-facing prompt, package version/hash, and no directory/glob/sibling/transitive permission. If source is not published, the owner must link an exact shipped `dist`/type file only after the evaluator/tool contract explicitly supports it and labels the degraded reference; it must not publish a dead link. Optional-package links are conditional on package emission. A missing, directory-only, symlinked, unpublished, wrong-version, or workspace-only target fails the generated-app link gate.

## Harness Regression

The source-selection case gives the agent a generated lean app and a small module task. `src/modules/example/**` is immutable harness context: a case may read declared files but may not write, rename, or delete them even when its writable roots otherwise include `src/modules/**`. Its ordered trace must show:

1. the relevant skill/guide is read;
2. `src/modules/example/README.md` is the first module-source entrypoint;
3. only capability-linked example files are read within the case budget;
4. no read under `ratelimit_probe` occurs; and
5. a visible declared installed-package link may be followed directly for a specialist/exact-host topic, while undeclared installed source still requires a named local/versioned contract gap; and
6. a UI-bearing case reads the normative emitted guide, exact example use, one exact PR #4301 gallery entry, and the separately declared exact UI implementation (plus local emitted token CSS only when relevant), never a gallery family directory, sibling entry, test, or workspace CSS path; and
7. a distinct Figma/token-facing case, only when the prompt requires it, reads the applicable PR #4277 sidecar: local token truth and/or one exact packed Code Connect file, plus the PR #4301 gallery/UI chain. It never reads placeholder nodes as live, broad `figma/`, monorepo-only snapshot/exporter paths, an unavailable skill, credentials, operations reports, or the network.

The output oracle rejects copied `example`, `example:todo`, route, event, ACL, and widget identifiers and rejects whole-tree copies, while requiring a distinct plural snake_case module ID, scoped entities, guarded/locked writes, translations, and generated-registry discipline. Its UI branch also rejects gallery-only evidence, copied gallery snippets/rules, invented props/imports, and runtime dependency edges in either direction between `example` and `design_system`; it requires the mapped public UI component shown in the example. A classic-preset assertion proves both references are source-present but disabled; it no longer needs to choose between two example modules.

The linked [Standalone Harness Example and Linked-Source Read Policy](./2026-08-01-standalone-harness-example-read-policy.md) owns generic schema, path safety, budgets, declared installed-source reads, and fallback semantics. This spec registers case-specific roots such as:

```json
{
  "root": "src/modules/example",
  "entrypoints": ["README.md", "references/surface-map.md"],
  "allowedCapabilityIds": ["api.crud-factory", "commands.write", "ui.form-shared"],
  "maxFiles": 12,
  "maxBytes": 131072
}
```

Case IDs are allocated only after semantic deduplication. Every affected case, validator/oracle, release-matrix lane, catalog count, documentation file, and emitted/generated harness copy moves together through `om-evolve-harness` and `om-refresh-standalone-harness`.

Deduplication must inspect at least OMH-027 (generic DataTable extension), OMH-181 (bulk-action implementation), and OMH-035 (progress routing). Their current assertions do not prove a canonical-example bulk action returning `progressJobId` or a visible top-bar lifecycle. Prefer strengthening the smallest existing cases and relating them over adding wording variants, but the final coverage must include one source-selection assertion for `ui.datatable.bulk-actions`, one for `runtime.operation-progress`, and one behavioral writable/oracle lane that proves the connected flow. Each records the exact `sourceReferenceIds` it followed.

## Testing and Validation

### Focused Coverage

1. Exact-tree parity: sorted paths and SHA-256 hashes match between monorepo and template; template-sync has no example exception or transform.
2. Preset matrix: `classic`, `empty`, and `crm` contain `src/modules/example/**`, pack the core design-system gallery sources, and register neither `example` nor `design_system`.
3. Template fixture: the disabled example tree typechecks in every preset; no example or design-system route, page, migration, seed, event, widget, worker, ACL grant, navigation entry, runtime chunk, or dead quick link is generated.
4. Activated fixtures: separately register `example` and `design_system`, run generation, assert the Todo identity for the former, and exercise existing CRUD/UI/UMES/extension tests plus the gallery route/ACL/search/deep-link/accessibility/copy/dark-mode contract without cross-enabling the modules.
5. Regression preservation: current Todo command scope/redo, API, UI, injection, override, dashboard, notification, adapter, and integration suites remain green after reconciliation.
6. Security: tenant/org isolation, 403, cross-scope 404, stale 409, encryption leakage, cache isolation, worker retry/idempotency, and audience scoping.
7. Source-map parity: every capability has one owner and exact live paths in all three layouts; repository-only tests are evidence but are not claimed as emitted files; no shadow implementation path remains.
8. Whole-harness link parity: all emitted knowledge owners are classified; every `source-required` topic has a visible exact-file link; all 136 fences across the exact eight baseline assets have a disposition; all links resolve in fresh packed-package fixtures; undeclared/orphan links, directories, wildcards, stale hashes, symlink escapes, wrong presets, and workspace-only paths fail.
9. Harness: fail-before/pass-after source selection, bounded read-only example/declared-installed access, mutation denial, renamed output, required-link trace, and affected certified lane evidence.
10. Instruction and source budgets: emitted `AGENTS.md`, README, surface map, and link inventory remain bounded; the compact root entrypoint replaces/moves existing prose instead of restoring old implementation blocks; new client components stay focused and do not grow existing oversized files.
11. Module facts: enum-derived coverage is exhaustive; separate reference-only example JSON/Markdown exists in every preset with portable exact links, `sourceKind: "local-reference"`, and `runtimeSelected: false`; normal package outputs exclude app-local modules without changing their current semantics; an activated fixture produces a matching fresh app-local extraction result; all expected owned/source/override/topology facts round-trip; repeated generation is byte-identical; no fact diagnostics or sensitive bodies/values appear.
12. Extension topology: all executable contribution/activation/target/policy/mechanism values and bound UI surfaces execute; catalog/framework/unbound/negative-fixture values have their permitted classification. Named fail-before/pass-after reader fixtures cover sibling page metadata, id-less workers, query-engine enablement, API method/phase bridges, mutation-guard shape/operation correlation, dashboard adapter reachability, AI file overrides, notification handlers, customer-role setup profiles, and the new `unknown-framework-mode` diagnostic.
13. Design-system references: every canonical example UI row resolves direct or `composite-not-direct` PR #4301 coverage, exact gallery constituent(s), exact public UI implementation, optional emitted token source, preset `source-only` status, visible provenance link, and after-opt-in route; the example source actually imports the mapped public component and neither module imports the other. Family counts and coverage allowlists are derived, never copied.
14. Design-foundation references: every entry in the derived PR #4301 gallery inventory has a PR #4277 applicability record, including entries not selected by the example; certification pins the final merged/package SHA, verifies final packed Code Connect files and exact non-`src` read exceptions on POSIX/Windows paths, derives calls and prop-variant coverage from AST, retains independent gallery/Code Connect node authorities plus their comparison, requires `publicationStatus: "not-evidenced"`, and rejects missing links, invalid cross-facet tuples, blanket mapping, partial-as-complete, unavailable or dependency-broken skill, default-tier leakage, workspace-only snapshot/exporter paths, credentials/network/publish actions, or runtime imports. If a local snapshot is emitted, deterministic export/source-rewrite/parity tests are mandatory.

Every added or materially changed runtime/discovery extension surface in the verified-gap table must name at least one module-local self-contained integration test in `surface-inventory.json`; adding a surface to an existing row does not bypass the gate. Unit/static/generator coverage is additive and cannot replace it. Tests create their own tenant-scoped fixtures, remove them in `finally`, declare every required optional module in `__integration__/meta.ts`, never rely on seeded/demo data, and pass both alone and in order-randomized/repeated execution. The authoring and template test trees stay byte-identical even though normal app scaffolding continues to filter `__tests__`/`__integration__`; the create-app integration controller stages the declared repository test against the activated disposable app and records it as repository-only QA evidence with `readStatus: "qa-only"`, never as emitted/readable source. The minimum activated-example matrix is:

| New extension | Exact integration test | Required modules | Required integration proof |
|---|---|---|---|

| Extension hosts and entity links | `__integration__/TC-EXAMPLE-005-extension-links.spec.ts` | `example`, `customers` | Exercise contributor-to-host read/write round trips, absent optional host, feature denial, and cross-scope rejection. |
| Search | `__integration__/TC-EXAMPLE-006-search.spec.ts` | `example`, `search`, `query_index` | Create/update/delete a Todo, reindex, query within scope, and prove sensitive/cross-scope data is absent. |
| Cache and rich DI | `__integration__/TC-EXAMPLE-007-cache.spec.ts` | `example` | Exercise the consumed scoped Awilix service, miss/hit plus create/update/delete invalidation and tenant/organization isolation through the real API; assert value-free registration kind/lifetime/source and exact safe DI override metadata. |
| DataTable bulk operation and progress | `__integration__/TC-EXAMPLE-003-todo-bulk-progress.spec.ts` | `example`, `progress`, `events`, `scheduler` | Separately assert the bulk-action source/registration and progress source/lifecycle: create at least two Todos, select them, start once, observe feedback and top-bar updates, verify refresh/cleared selection, race duplicate requests with one idempotency key and assert one progress ID/logical execution, simulate crash before publish and recover from the durable outbox, simulate a mid-worker crash after one checkpoint and resume without repeating its mutation, tolerate duplicate physical messages, force mixed and total failures, cancel between items, deny cross-scope IDs, assert terminal events, and clean up. |

| Extension facts and activations | `__integration__/TC-EXAMPLE-012-extension-facts-topology.spec.ts` | `example`, `customers`, `dashboards`, `events`, `notifications`, `integrations`, `customer_accounts` | Assert the enum-derived ledger; all emitted contribution, activation, target, policy, three-resolution-set, host-family, capability, override-domain/mode/note/diagnostic, lifecycle, and operation rows; literal Todo enricher/guard/command callers; cross-module incoming indexes; portal reaction; zero unresolved diagnostics; and exact portable source links. Assert the separate disabled reference wrapper and unchanged normal-output exclusion, then activate the fixture and prove semantic parity with a fresh app-local extraction.

| Generator plugin | `__integration__/TC-EXAMPLE-016-generator-plugin.spec.ts` | `example` | In a disposable activated app, run generation twice, verify the reference index is consumed and byte-identical, reject stale/duplicate output and runtime imports, prove portable source facts, then disable example and prove its plugin/output is absent. |

PR #4301 mapping uses a static contract test plus the existing activated UI integration paths rather than inventing a fake data endpoint. The static test resolves each `designSystemReferences[]` row against the merged packed gallery registry/entry, exact UI implementation, optional emitted token source, and example import. It consumes the gallery coverage/integrity/render-smoke results without making those QA-only files readable. The activated list/create/edit/bulk/notification/host Playwright paths prove mapped components render and interact without hydration or console errors; the separately activated gallery integration evidence covers route/ACL/search/deep links/accessibility/copy/dark mode. Every built-in fresh-preset test requires `source-only` and a missing route/nav entry; only the explicit activation fixture may mark the route `live` and open it under a user with `design_system.view`.

PR #4277 validation supplements that static test without adding a runtime endpoint. Against its final merged/package baseline, pack inspection proves each declared `figma/*.figma.tsx` target is shipped, AST correlation derives mappings and coverage, and per-item assertions retain honest placeholder/unmapped/not-applicable states. At the audited head, only known-node records may expose normalized node IDs and incomplete Button variant coverage remains `partial`; final certification recomputes these facts rather than freezing those provisional observations. Token export/parser tests and Code Connect parse checks are QA-only evidence, not readable implementation context or proof that Figma nodes exist or mappings were published. Default-tier fixtures prove the design skill is unavailable unless a separately tested local `design` tier is emitted.

The source-routing README/inventory itself uses fresh-scaffold link/inventory tests rather than inventing a runtime integration test, because it adds no runtime extension. Local module-fact generation additionally has create-app/CLI generator tests and is exercised by TC-EXAMPLE-012/016; those static tests supplement rather than replace runtime integration for the surfaces represented. Any future added/materially changed runtime or discovery surface with `coverageKind: "example"` is rejected unless it declares its focused integration-test paths and dependency modules, regardless of whether its containing capability row already existed.

### Validation Sequence

Choose Docker or local mode once according to `.ai/docs/agent-instructions.md`, record the runner, then run:

```bash
yarn template:sync
yarn build:packages
yarn generate
yarn build:packages
yarn workspace create-mercato-app test
yarn test:create-app
yarn test:create-app:integration
yarn agents:check-budget
yarn check:client-boundaries
yarn typecheck
yarn lint
yarn test
yarn build:app
```

Run the affected harness lane and its knowledge-change manifest through the owning workflow. Do not apply migrations locally merely to validate the fixture.

## Backward Compatibility

- No framework API, import, event, widget, CLI, or database contract is removed or renamed.
- Existing `example` identifiers and paths remain stable; the design eliminates the proposed, unshipped duplicate identifiers.
- Existing repositories are not modified. The observable behavior change applies only to newly generated `classic` apps, where `example` becomes source-present but runtime-disabled.
- Lean presets gain additive source files and stop deleting `example`; their runtime remains unchanged because registration stays absent.
- Normal `.ai/guides/module-facts.json` retains its combined package-module meaning, and `.ai/guides/modules/**` retains its enabled-filtered package-Markdown meaning. The new reference-only JSON/Markdown artifacts are additive generated-file contracts, explicitly mark the disabled local projection, and are parity-checked against a fresh activated app-local extraction without mutating either normal output.
- PR #4301 gallery references are additive documentation/provenance metadata. Example runtime imports remain public `@open-mercato/ui` paths, so the design-system module and example stay independently activatable.
- PR #4277 design-foundation records are additive tooling/provenance metadata. They grant no runtime import, Figma credential/network/publish authority, or claim that provisional mappings are merged, complete, live, or published.
- Fresh standalone registries omit `design_system`; existing applications and the monorepo app are not rewritten, and explicit downstream registration restores the unchanged PR #4301 route/ACL contract.
- Future removal or rename of `src/modules/example` requires the documented deprecation protocol once external tools rely on it.

## Risks & Impact Review

| Failure scenario | Severity | Mitigation | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monorepo and template drift again | High | One authoring root, existing sync fixer/check, exact hash test, no example exceptions. | Low. |
| Baseline sync copies stale or unsafe behavior | High | Review all 20 current differing paths before sync; preserve scoped commands, redo, and tests. | Low after reconciliation review. |
| Broad QA module overwhelms agent context | Medium | README-first progressive disclosure, capability IDs, dual file/byte budgets, whole-tree-copy rejection. | Low. |
| Example is accidentally enabled | High | Registration-absence tests for all presets and runtime-surface negative fixture. | Low. |
| Classic users expect demo pages in a fresh scaffold | Medium | Explicit release note and preset regression; source remains available for one-line opt-in. | Medium. |
| A gap grows into another mini-domain | Medium | Extend Todo or route to an authoritative specialist source; require spec amendment for inventory growth. | Low. |
| Skill links and source drift | High | Exact link tests across authoring/template/emitted layouts and knowledge-governance gate. | Low. |
| Sensitive/scoped data leaks through new examples | High | Encryption, scoped queries, safe payloads, cache/audience tests, no cross-module ORM. | Low after focused tests. |
| Disabled reference facts are mistaken for current runtime bindings | High | Separate reference artifact, explicit local-reference/runtime-selected discriminators, unchanged normal package-output exclusion, activated-extractor parity, and evaluator wording that says “after opt-in.” | Low. |
| Gallery and example references drift or become coupled | High | Pin the merged/package PR #4301 baseline, validate direct/composite/import/source/route mappings from packed artifacts, and forbid runtime imports across the two modules. | Low. |
| Fresh standalone unexpectedly exposes the developer gallery | Medium | Omit `design_system` from every generated registry, assert no route/nav/chunk/ACL grant, and keep activation in a separate fixture. | Low. |
| PR #4277 tooling is mistaken for complete or runtime-authoritative coverage | High | Require a final merged/package SHA, per-item applicability, AST/pack derivation, placeholder/partial/publish distinctions, local CSS authority, and no application import or external execution. | Low after final-baseline certification. |

## Implementation Plan

### Milestone A, Phase 1 — Reconcile and Lock the Canonical Tree

1. Classify the current 20 differing paths, preserve the correct monorepo behavior, and make the two example trees byte-identical through `yarn template:sync:fix`.
2. Add the exact parity test and prohibit example-specific template exceptions/transforms.
3. Add the README, finite inventory, and surface map using only verified existing paths and capability owners.

Exit criterion: `yarn template:sync` and the focused parity test pass, and the map distinguishes existing coverage from verified gaps.

### Milestone A, Phase 2 — Ship Both Reference Modules Inert in Every Preset

1. Stop deleting `src/modules/example` from `empty`/`crm` and remove its default classic registration.
2. Remove or registry-gate example-only home quick links, remove `design_system` from the standalone template registry, then add source-present/registration-absent tests and negative runtime-surface assertions for both reference modules in all presets.
3. Add separate explicit activation fixtures that generate, compile, and exercise the existing Todo slice and the PR #4301 gallery without cross-enabling them.

Exit criterion: every scaffold ships the exact example source and packed gallery source, activates neither reference module, and each explicit activation remains functional independently.

### Milestone B — Extend Only Missing Core and Runtime Surfaces

1. Deliver each verified encryption, extension/link, search/vector, translations, setup hooks/defaults/examples, shared-form, cache/rich-DI, Todo bulk-progress, client/portal notification, page middleware, AI, integration/provider/workflow, generator-plugin, fact-readable UI-host, and topology row as an independently green vertical slice against the existing Todo domain.
2. For the bulk-progress slice, land the exact injected action, scoped/idempotent 202 route, durable operation/outbox helper, scheduler dispatcher, leased/checkpointed worker lifecycle, progress result contract, and `TC-EXAMPLE-003-todo-bulk-progress.spec.ts` together.
3. Add the self-contained integration test named by every added/materially changed example extension surface, plus enum-ledger/generator fixtures and focused unit/security/isolation/retry/conflict/event/search/vector/cache/notification/generation/migration tests as appropriate.

Exit criterion: every `example` inventory row has a real caller/test and no duplicate domain or placeholder file exists.

### Milestone C — Synchronize Skills and Harness

1. Classify the complete emitted owner set and all 136 fences in the exact eight `main` baseline assets, then render visible exact-file links in every `source-required` guide/skill/reference/fact owner while preserving normative rule ownership and emitted tiers.
2. Generate the source-link inventory, separate local example reference-facts JSON/Markdown, and enum-derived topology ledger; preserve the normal combined-package JSON and enabled-package Markdown contracts; register canonical-example, PR #4301 design-system-gallery, per-item PR #4277 applicability, and other declared-installed references; and add failure-first source-selection/read-policy cases after semantic deduplication.
3. Synchronize validators/oracles, release matrix, counts/docs, knowledge manifest, link hashes, package/preset applicability, and generated harness copies through the owning workflows.

Exit criterion: relevant agents follow visible exact links within budget, all baseline topics have a checked disposition, local and installed targets resolve from packed fresh scaffolds, the disabled local example has an explicit reference-only projection while unchanged normal package outputs exclude app-local modules, activated-extractor parity passes, unrelated reads fail, and every affected harness surface agrees.

### Milestone D — Certify Monorepo and Standalone Behavior

1. Run monorepo example tests, every declared new-extension integration test alone and repeated/order-randomized, PR #4883 enum/topology/override-target contract tests, template parity, preset matrix, activated standalone fixture, packed-package/local-fact link validation, final PR #4277 token/Code Connect/tier derivation and negative fixtures, create-app integration, and the configured validation gate.
2. Run the affected certified harness lane and capture sanitized evidence.
3. Re-read the diff for accidental activation, stale mirror files, copied identifiers, dead links, placeholders, and scope drift.

Exit criterion: both environments are green, the example trees are identical, new apps are runtime-inert, and the harness uses the emitted example as its canonical module reference.

### Compliance Matrix

| Area | Result |
|---|---|
| Scope cohesion | The fresh reviewer recommended splitting delivery, runtime slices, fact topology, and harness migration. Maintainer decision Q7 explicitly retains one program umbrella because the required outcome is one shipped canonical reference, while each delivery/per-gap/harness/certification milestone remains independently mergeable and the three generic policies already live in companion specs. |
| Canonical mechanism | Reuses the live Todo CRUD, commands, CrudForm/DataTable, events, UMES, and widget surfaces; gaps extend the same module. |
| Module isolation | Tenant/org scope, IDs/snapshots, optional hosts, and no cross-module ORM relationships remain mandatory. |
| Optimistic locking | Existing `updated_at`/`updatedAt` and default CRUD/child lock rules stay part of the activated proof. |
| Security/encryption | New sensitive example data requires encryption maps, decrypting reads, and leakage tests. |
| Template ownership | Monorepo authoring source and byte-identical template mirror are explicit and machine-enforced. |
| Runtime boundary | Source ships everywhere; registration and every derived runtime surface remain absent until opt-in. |
| Harness | Every emitted owner and prior implementation topic is classified; visible exact local/installed links, packed resolution, capability budgets, source-selection traces, and synchronized release assets are specified. |
| Bulk progress | The Todo DataTable selected-row action, guarded route, real queue/worker, `progressJobId`, and platform top-bar lifecycle form one canonical end-to-end reference. |
| Integration coverage | Every added or materially changed runtime/discovery extension surface declares self-contained activated integration tests and dependencies; static/unit proof alone is rejected. |
| Module facts/topology | The disabled local example receives a separate, explicitly reference-only portable projection covering executable PR #4883 source, contribution, activation, target, three-resolution, policy, registry, override, diagnostic, and bound-host mechanisms; normal package outputs keep their existing semantics; catalog/framework/unbound/negative-fixture values are explicit. |
| Design system | Every canonical example UI row maps direct or honest composite constituent coverage to the merged PR #4301 gallery and exact packed UI source; all fresh presets are `source-only`, explicit activation proves the route, and the modules remain runtime-decoupled. |
| Design foundation | Every entry in the derived PR #4301 gallery inventory carries honest PR #4277 applicability; local CSS remains token truth, exact packed Code Connect files are Figma-only references, and unavailable/placeholder/partial/publication-not-evidenced states cannot be promoted. |
| Frontend architecture | Todos route roots stay or become server components; interactive forms/table/widgets are bounded client islands; no global provider is added; LOC, hydration, boundary, build, and Playwright evidence are explicit. |
| Compatibility | No shipped framework contract changes; the fresh-classic default behavior change is explicit and tested. |
| Open questions | None; reuse, disablement, exact sync, and additive extension were explicitly directed. |

### Internal Consistency Check

| Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Source ownership matches delivery | Pass | `apps/mercato` authors; template mirrors; emitted app copies the mirror. |
| Inventory matches implementation strategy | Pass | Existing surfaces are linked; verified gaps extend Todo/example only. |
| Runtime boundary matches tests | Pass | Preset negative assertions and activated fixture cover both states. |
| Skill routing matches harness reads | Pass | Both use `src/modules/example` plus the same capability inventory. |
| Prior example coverage matches visible links | Pass | All 136 fences in the exact eight baseline assets receive a checked disposition and every source-required owner renders an exact-file link. |
| Risks cover writes and synchronization | Pass | Scope, locking, encryption, queues, cache, audiences, and drift are explicit. |

### Non-Compliant Items

None at design level. Implementation remains blocked from completion until the baseline tree drift is reconciled and all configured gates pass.

### Verdict

**Fully specified and ready for implementation after design review.**

## Changelog

- 2026-08-01: Expanded the proposed reference coverage and split spec-first routing, generic read policy, and harness governance into companion specs.
- 2026-08-03: Replaced the proposed duplicate teaching module with the existing `example` module as the sole standalone reference; required source-present/runtime-disabled delivery in every preset, additive gap extensions, exact skill/harness source links, byte-identical synchronization from `apps/mercato` to the create-app template, and an explicit `referenceStatus` separate from capability coverage kind.
- 2026-08-03: Added whole-harness `main` snippet parity, visible exact canonical/installed links, packed-package link validation, a connected Todo DataTable bulk-operation progress reference, and mandatory self-contained integration tests for every new example extension.
- 2026-08-03: Made delivery/per-gap/harness/certification milestones independently mergeable; specified the historical-block ledger schema, location-independent mirrored links, the concrete injected Todo bulk-progress protocol, and exact integration-test/dependency rows for every new extension.
- 2026-08-03: Pinned the exact eight historical assets, hashes, and 136 CommonMark fences; made Todo bulk publication at-least-once through a durable operation outbox plus scheduler recovery and leased/checkpointed execution.
- 2026-08-03: Audited PR #4883's complete module-fact/extension taxonomy; required local example fact generation (subsequently refined to a separate reference-only projection), statically readable registries, every executable mechanism and bound UI surface, explicit catalog/unbound classifications, specialist-depth links, and integration tests for all new additions.
- 2026-08-03: Corrected disabled-module fact semantics with a separate reference-only projection and activated-extractor parity while preserving combined-package JSON/enabled-package Markdown outputs; expanded all three resolution and closed diagnostic sets, override domains/modes/notes/nested hosts, negative fixtures, reviewed reader-parity fixtures, AI file overrides, customer-role setup, notification handlers, explicit local-source discrimination, canonical fingerprints, and the frontend architecture contract.
- 2026-08-03: Added PR #4301 as the living design-system provenance baseline; required visible exact gallery-entry and live-route references, mapped every canonical example UI use to the public component demonstrated by the gallery, and prohibited runtime coupling or copied gallery snippets.
- 2026-08-03: Updated the merged PR #4301 baseline, distinguished direct entries from constituent coverage for composites, and made `design_system` source-present but registration/route/nav/runtime-disabled in every newly generated standalone app with a separate activation fixture.
- 2026-08-03: Added PR #4277 as a per-design-item tooling sidecar: local token truth, role-gated packed Code Connect references, closed applicability/mapping/node/publish/tier states, final-baseline certification, and explicit prohibitions on fabricated coverage or Figma execution authority.

### Review — 2026-08-03

- **Reviewer:** Agent, with independent fresh-context scope-cohesion and cross-spec consistency passes.
- **Scope cohesion:** The fresh pass recommended splitting the broad program. Q7 is the recorded maintainer decision to retain the umbrella invariant while defining independently mergeable canonical-delivery, per-gap, harness-migration, and certification milestones; generic policies remain independently deliverable in the three companion specs.
- **Security:** Passed at design level; exposed example files require scoped, locked, encrypted, reference-quality behavior or `referenceStatus: "qa-only"` exclusion.
- **Performance:** Passed; emitted-size facts, bounded reads, and focused-file growth constraints replace the invalid small-module budget.
- **Cache:** Passed at design level; the missing cache example is DI-resolved, tenant/org tagged, and invalidated on every Todo write path.
- **Commands:** Passed; existing scoped command, undo/redo, and optimistic-lock behavior is preserved and regression-tested.
- **Risks:** Passed; baseline drift, accidental activation, dead links, classic behavior change, context breadth, and source-link drift are explicit.
- **Verdict:** Approved for design review under the explicit Q7 milestone boundaries.
