# Stabilize flaky integration tests by finding the hang, not by raising the timeout

**Context**: `TC-CUR-004` ("Set Base Currency from UI") failed ~1/60 in the `ephemeral-integration` CI shards with `Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded` plus a secondary `apiRequestContext.fetch: Target page, context or browser has been closed` reported from the `finally` teardown.

**Problem**: The secondary "context closed" error is a symptom of the test-level timeout tearing the worker down mid-request — it is not the cause. Two real causes hid behind it: (1) the row-actions dropdown is opened with `actionsButton.press('Enter')` and then the menu item is clicked directly; if the Radix trigger swallows the keypress before hydration, the menu never opens and `.click()` auto-waits on a never-mounting element until the whole test times out; (2) login + navigation + three sequential ≤10s waits + fixture setup/teardown genuinely does not fit a 30s budget under 15-shard parallel load — every other login+nav spec already uses 60–120s, and this one was the lone 30s outlier.

**Rule**: When an integration test "times out," read the trace to find which await actually blocked before reaching for a bigger number. Make UI interactions deterministic: after a keyboard-driven menu open, assert the target item is visible with a *bounded* budget and fall back to a pointer click, so a missed keypress fails fast instead of hanging until the suite timeout. Make `finally` teardown best-effort (`.catch(() => {})`) so it cannot mask the real failure with a "context closed" error. Only after removing the hang should you align the per-test budget with the established login+nav convention. Prefer fixing the interaction over inflating the clock.

**Applies to**: every Playwright spec under `**/__integration__/*.spec.ts` that drives `RowActions`/dropdown menus via keyboard, and any spec whose `finally` block issues API calls after the body may have failed.
