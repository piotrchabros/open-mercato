/**
 * PR-path guard for the release-time version-alignment gate.
 *
 * `scripts/check-version-alignment.sh` asserts that every public `packages/*` manifest carries
 * the monorepo version, and it is load-bearing at release time and nowhere else:
 * `scripts/bump-version.sh:17` and `:29`, `scripts/release-existing.sh:13`, and
 * `.github/workflows/release.yml:72`. No PR-triggered workflow invoked it, so a misaligned
 * workspace passed CI and first failed days later at the release's very first gate, detached
 * from the merge that caused it (#5018).
 *
 * The drift is not a slip but a property of the branching model: a workspace added on `develop`
 * between two releases does not exist on `main` at the release commit, so the release bump never
 * touches it and the next `main` → `develop` sync has nothing to reconcile. That is how
 * `@open-mercato/telemetry` stayed at `0.6.6` while everything else moved to `0.6.7` (#5014),
 * and it will recur the next time a package is introduced mid-cycle. For telemetry the blast
 * radius reached past the gate: `packages/create-app` pins template dependencies to
 * `{{PACKAGE_VERSION}}` (`packages/create-app/AGENTS.md`), so a package out of lockstep makes a
 * fresh scaffold's `yarn install` fail with "No candidates found" — as at `0.6.3` vs `0.6.5`
 * (`.ai/specs/2026-04-29-telemetry-and-otel.md`).
 *
 * This lives in `scripts/__tests__/` rather than in `REPO_WIDE_GUARDS` deliberately. CI runs
 * `yarn test:scripts` unconditionally and unfiltered (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:628`), outside
 * the `--filter=[base]...` scoping that selects packages by dependency graph and would skip a
 * version-only `package.json` edit entirely; `ci.yml:666` already names `yarn test:scripts`
 * among the guards that "already run unfiltered". `scripts/repo-wide-guards.mjs` is a
 * jest-per-workspace runner whose enumeration honesty check only scans `/\.test\.tsx?$/`, so an
 * `.mjs` script test has no place in it.
 *
 * The comparison is reimplemented here in plain Node so the guard needs no `jq` or `bash` on the
 * common PR path. The last test pins the shell script's scope so the two cannot silently desync.
