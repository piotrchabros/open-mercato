/**
 * Reconcile the `organization_id` of existing attachments to the organization
 * of the record they are attached to.
 *
 * Background (#3765): before the upload route became selected-organization
 * aware, a multi-org admin who switched the header organization uploaded files
 * that were silently stored under their *home* organization instead of the
 * selected one (the organization of the parent record). Those rows are now
 * invisible to org-scoped reads and stay orphaned. This heals them forward.
 *
 * The parent record's organization is the ground truth: an attachment is not
 * distinguishable from a legitimately home-org one by looking at the attachment
 * alone. Parent organizations are resolved generically through the Query Engine
 * by `entityId` (works for both base and custom entities, tenant-scoped and
 * organization-agnostic so the parent's real org is returned regardless of
 * which org the caller sits in) — the same mechanism the attachments module
 * already uses to enrich assignment details.
 *
 * The reconciliation is:
 * - idempotent — rows already matching their parent are left untouched;
 * - conservative — when the parent org cannot be resolved (unregistered
 *   entity id, hard-deleted parent, parent without an org column) the row is
 *   counted as `unresolved` and left as-is rather than guessed at;
 * - tenant-scoped — it reconciles every attachment in the tenant across all
 *   organizations (the whole point is moving rows between orgs).
 *
 * Writes go through the passed `EntityManager` (which the caller runs inside a
 * transaction) so the whole reconciliation commits atomically.
