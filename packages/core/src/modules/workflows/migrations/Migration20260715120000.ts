/**
 * Repairs the former seeded checkout demo after it was renamed to the same ID

 * definition, including its obsolete external inventory webhook.
 *
 * The persisted row must remain active because historical and in-flight
 * workflow instances reference it by definition_id — a random UUID the
 * code-registry fallback in find-definition.ts deliberately never substitutes.
 * The migration removes the activity arrays from the three transitions that
 * the maintained code definition intentionally made side-effect-free,
 * preserving the row and all instance references while keeping the demo
 * self-contained. (Fresh installs never had this row; they execute the virtual
 * code definition directly via findDefinitionForInstance.)
 *
 * `confirmation_to_end` is deliberately NOT rebuilt: unlike the three stripped
 * transitions it still holds activities in the maintained code definition, and
 * its legacy-only extra (`emit_order_completed`, an internal `EMIT_EVENT`) is
 * harmless — it emits no external request, so leaving it costs nothing and
 * avoids fragile per-activity surgery that could re-introduce a failure.
