 * Outbound delivery worker.
 *
 * Dispatches the `deliver_outbound_message` command which performs the actual
 * send. The command returns a classified result:
 *   - `delivered` / `already_delivered` / `no_channel_link` → success, return.
 *   - `failed` with `transient: true` → re-enqueue with exponential backoff,
 *      incremented attempt, up to `OUTBOUND_DELIVERY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`.
 *   - `failed` with `transient: false` → permanent failure, no retry.
 *
 * The command already wrote the failure record + emitted `.delivery_failed`,
 * so the worker just decides whether to schedule another attempt.
 *
 * We DO NOT throw on a recorded delivery-failure outcome — that would let the
 * queue apply its own retry policy on top of ours, double-retrying. Explicit
 * re-enqueue with delayMs is the portable, controllable pattern. The one
 * exception is an *unexpected* exception from the command itself (e.g. a DB blip
 * that stopped it from recording anything): we re-enqueue up to our max and then
 * rethrow so the infrastructure failure surfaces to the queue's dead-letter
 * instead of vanishing. The command's idempotency prevents a double-send.
