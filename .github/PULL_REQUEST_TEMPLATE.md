## Checklist

- [ ] This pull request targets `develop`.
- [ ] I have read and accept the Open Mercato Contributor License Agreement (see `docs/cla.md`).
- [ ] I updated documentation, locales, or generators if the change requires it.
- [ ] I added or adjusted tests that cover the change.
- [ ] I added or updated integration tests in `.ai/qa/tests/` (or documented why integration coverage is not required).
- [ ] I created or updated the spec in `.ai/specs/` with a changelog entry (if applicable).
- [ ] Priority set: this PR carries exactly one `priority-*` label.
- [ ] Risk set: this PR carries exactly one `risk-*` label describing its blast radius (`risk-low`/`risk-medium`/`risk-high`).
- [ ] QA routing set: `skip-qa` for low-risk non-customer-facing changes — and for changes with no manually exercisable UI surface that leave the database structure and API surface unchanged, preserve `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` contracts, and ship automated tests for the behavior they change — otherwise `needs-qa`. A `needs-qa` PR cannot merge until QA adds `qa-approved` (or an engineer self-QAs: run locally, click through, attach a screenshot/written confirmation, then add `qa-approved` + `qa-self-verified` — without `triage` permission, post the evidence and ask a maintainer to apply those two labels). See `.github/QA-DEPLOYMENT.md` and `AGENTS.md` → PR Workflow for the authoritative rules.

### Design System Compliance
- [ ] No hardcoded status colors (`text-red-*`, `bg-green-*`, `text-emerald-*`, `bg-amber-*`, `bg-blue-*`) — use semantic tokens
- [ ] No arbitrary text sizes (`text-[Npx]`) — use typography scale or `text-overline`
- [ ] Empty state handled for list/data pages (`<EmptyState>` or DataTable `emptyState` prop)
- [ ] Loading state handled for async pages
- [ ] `aria-label` on all icon-only buttons (`<IconButton>`)
- [ ] Uses existing DS components (Alert, StatusBadge, FormField) — no custom replacements
